            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And thus it comes to paſſe, and indeed it cannot be otherwiſe with ſuch that have not their minds ſtayed and fixed in that which is perfect and true, and clear and ſingle, as is the clear manifeſtation of the Grace of Life, which is the Light of the Lord Jeſus ſhining in the heart and conſcience of the ſons and daughters of men; and the ſame Light of the Lord which enlightneth the poor and deceitful man's eyes, is the true meaſure and equal ballance, which all are to try, and prove, and weigh words, thoughts, intents, wayes and actions, whether they be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable

            <p>Therefore, when thou haſt honeſtly read this throughout with a meek ſpirit of ſobriety and moderation, that's ſingle and pure, then with the ſame ſpirit of ſingleneſs and of true diſcerning, judge honeſtly, and ceaſe from haſtineſs in ſuch matters of Eternity, leſt a place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance become finally hid from thine

               </gap>f this world, to ſee the wiſdom of God diſpenſed through a weak Veſſel? as is a free-born woman from above, a weaker Veſſel than that of the man.</p>
            <p>Now tell me, O man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, What muſt not the Spirit of Chriſt, or the ſame that is begotten of God in the female, as well as in the male, what muſt not (I ſay) the ſame Spirit of Life from God ſpeak, but be limited in the weaker Veſſel, in the fooliſh Veſſel, in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which is not eſteemed, but baſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and deſpiſed in the eyes of lofty man, that muſt be laid low, who excels in that wiſdom and knowledge which is not from above, but otherwiſe, bruitiſh, and puffeth up the fleſhly mind that's enmity to God, and is therefore to be confounded and moved backward, and

<pb facs="tcp:38158:10"/> my ſoul, how haſt thou been wounded in me, whilſt I have travelled and mourned over you! And ſo you have been found deſpiſing that, and quenching that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace which teacheth the Saints in Light, and reproves for ſin, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth againſt the World and its deeds, becauſe they are evil.</p>
            <p>And this ſame Spirit ſtrived long with you, and in you, and would have ariſen up in its Authority, Power and great Glory from on high, had ye not preferred and exalted the ſpirit of this World in its proper place in you, above the Juſt and Long-ſuffering, which is but one and the ſame in male and fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male.</p>
            <p>Oh! what have you done? Can any of you yet ſmite upon your thigh, and ſay ſo yet? if ye can, enquire, enquire ye, the Watchman's voice is the ſame it was, and not otherwiſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Return, come; yea, return and come to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Spirit of holineſs, and of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb facs="tcp:38158:11"/> of Chriſt, and his yoke of Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and the daily Croſs, they are the two great Ordinances which ye have left behind; and ſo the Vail and the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath covered you; but the <hi>true Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> have Light in their dwellings, and their habitations are in the beſt of the Land of the living.</p>
            <p>Wherefore my ſpirit ſaith, Return, come and hearken to the Lamb's Voice, and now ſee whether ye can follow Him (or a ſtranger) whereſoever he goeth, that's the true Prophet, raiſed up like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> and obey his Voice, which ſavoureth not of this World; for ſo his Kingdom and Servants are not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beware, leſt your ſouls be cut off from the Land of the Living, and ye periſh in the outward obſervations, (by which the Kingdom cometh not) among the Congregations of the dead, where ye are yet ſeeking the living; But I, as a Brother (even <hi>Joſeph</hi>) tel you yet again, <hi>He is not there,</hi> but is ariſen from the
<pb facs="tcp:38158:11"/> dead, from death to life, who is the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Spirit, the Lord from Heaven, over the Earth, over all the Land <hi>Aegypt,</hi> over the Land of Darkneſs; the ſame Lord, the ſame Spirit which hath done excellent things, is exalted in the new Heaven, and in the new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs; and let the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Daughter of Sion publiſh the ſame, even from hence forth to all generations; yea, and my ſpirit is ready to ſay, <hi>Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was one that ſaw a little Stone cut out of the Mountain without hands, and he well retained his ſight ſo long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til (in the Light of the living) he ſaw the ſame which was ſo little, wax ſo great, that it became an exceeding great Mountain.</p>
            <p>Verily, the beloved City is manifeſt, ſet upon a holy Hill; it cannot be bid from them that ſee; the Glory of God doth enlighten it, <hi>and the Lamb is the Light thereof,</hi> and his Light is like
<pb facs="tcp:38158:12"/> unto a Stone moſt precious, clear as Chryſtal.</p>
            <p>The Fountain is opened free; come down from on high, and thou ſhalt ſee if thou doſt thirſt for Springs of Life. To the Light ſubmit thy mind, and ceaſe from ſtrife, in the ſame to behold the Bride, the Lamb's Wife, from the falſe Church.</p>

            <p>O Ye Eternal and bleſſed Ones, whoſe dwelling is on high, in the fulneſs of all Beauty and Brightneſs, Glory, and everlaſting Joy, Happineſs and Peace for evermore; We who are poor Sufferers for the Seed of God, in the Covenant of Light, Life and Truth, do dearly ſalute and imbrace you all, according to our meaſures, Bleſſing, and Honour and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be given to our Lord God for ever, of all who know him, who hath counted us worthy, and hath choſen us among his faithful Ones, to bear his Name, and to witneſs forth his Truth, before the High
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:38158:13"/> and Mighty men of the Earth, and to fight the Lord's Battel with his ſpiritual Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, to the breaking down of ſtrong holds, high lofty looks and vain imaginations, and ſpiritual wickedneſs in high places.</p>
            <p>The Lord did give us a proſperous Journey hither, and when we came to <hi>Legorn,</hi> we were refreſhed with Friends [who were there before us] and they did get a paſſage for us (and lodging) but as ſoon as we heard of the Veſſel, we did feel our Service. So we went into the City in the living Power of the Lord, and there were many tender hearts did viſit us, to their comfort, and our joy: The little time we ſtaid there, we gave ſome of our Books and one Paper: ſo journying towards <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria,</hi> the Captain told us that <hi>Malta</hi> was in the way, and he muſt put in there a ſmall time. But before we came there, our burthen was ſo heavy, that I was made to cry out (ſaying) <hi>Oh we have a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Cup to drink at that place! Oh how am I ſtraitned till it be accompliſhed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when we came there, the Walls of the City were full of people; ſome ſtood on the top of the Walls, as if ſomething had troubled them. Before we came there,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:38158:13"/> we ſtood upon the Deck of the Ship, and I looked upon them, and ſaid in my heart, <hi>Shall ye deſtroy us? If we give up to the Lord, then he is ſufficient to deliver us out of their hands; but if we diſobey our God, all thoſe could not deliver us out of his hand.</hi> So all fear of man was taken from us.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh Conſul came aboard the Ship (as the Captain ſaid) but we did not ſee him, and invited us to his Houſe, it was the ſeventh, or laſt day of the week. The next morning, being moved of the Lord, we went a-ſhore, and the Conſul met us, and we gave him a Paper, who ſent us to his Houſe with his Servant; and when we came there, at the preſent we were well entertained (like Princes) their <hi>Neighbours</hi> and <hi>Kinsfolk</hi> came in, and ſome <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and we gave them Books; they read a little, and laid them down, they were too hot: We declared our Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to them in the Name of the Lord, and we gave ſome Books in the Street; ſo they were all ſet on work. Away went the Friars to the King (or Supream in the Iſland) and he would not meddle with us, but ſaid, we were honeſt women, we might go about our buſineſs; and that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:38158:14"/> night we went a-board the Ship again: the Conſul was troubled, for their ſnare was laid, and we felt it: Being moved of the Lord, we went in again the next day, and the Conſul having a Siſter in the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery, deſired us to go thither, that ſhe might ſee us; and we went to them, and gave them a Boo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            <p>A True Declaration concerning the Lord's love to us in all our Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. We were at Sea, between <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Plymouth,</hi> many Weeks, and one day we had ſome tryals; and between <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Legorn</hi> we were 31. days, and we had many tryals and ſtorms within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; but the Lord did deliver us out of all. And when we came to <hi>Legorn,</hi> with the reſt of our friends, we went into the Town after we had product, and ſtayed there ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes, where we had ſervice every day; for all ſorts of People came unto us, but no man did offer to hurt us, yet we gave them Books; and having got paſſage in a Dutch ſhip, we ſailed towards <hi>Cyprus,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to go to <hi>Alexandria;</hi> but the Lord had appointed ſomething for us to do by the way, as he did make it manifeſt to us, as I did ſpeak; for the Maſter of the ſhip had no buſineſs in the place, but being in company with another ſhip, which had

               </gap>rning our coming, and we told him truth, and gave him ſome Books, and a Paper, and he told us there was an Inquiſition, and he kindly entreated us to go to his houſe, and ſaid, All that he had was at our ſervice while we were there. And in the fear and dread of the Lord we went, and there came many to ſee us, and we called them to repentance, and many of them were tender, but the whole City is given to Idolatry. And we went a ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board that night, and the next day we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moved to go into the City again, dared not to flee the Croſs, but in obedience went, deſiring the will of God to be done. And when we came to the Governour, he told us that he had a ſiſter in the Nunnery did deſire to ſee us if we were free; and in the fear of God we went, and talked with them, and gave them a Book, and one of their Prieſts was with us (at the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery) and had us into their place of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and ſome would have us bow to the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:38158:15"/> high Altar, which we did deny; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a great burthen, we went to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul again, and were waiting upon the Lord what to do, that we might know.</p>
            <p>And the Inquiſitors ſent for us, and when we came before them, they asked our Names, and the Names of our Husbands, and the Names of our Fathers and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and how many Children we had; and they asked us, <hi>Wherefore we came into that Country?</hi> And we told them, We were the Servants of the living God, and were moved to come and call them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and many other Queſtions, and they went away, but commanded that we ſhould be ſtayed there. And the next day they came again, and called for us, and we came; but they would examine us apart, and called <hi>Sarah,</hi> and they asked, <hi>Whether ſhe was a true Catholick?</hi> She ſaid, That ſhe was a true Chriſtian that worſhippeth God in Spirit and in Truth; and they proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her the Crucifix, and would have had her ſwear that ſhe would ſpeak the Truth; and ſhe ſaid ſhe ſhould ſpeak the Truth, but ſhe would not ſwear, for Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her <hi>not to ſwear,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Swear not at all:</hi> And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul perſwaded her with much entreating, to ſwear, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:38158:16"/> 
               <hi>None ſhould do her any harm:</hi> But ſhe denied; and they took ſome Books from her, and would have had her ſwear by them, but ſhe would not: And they asked, <hi>Wherefore ſhe brought the Books?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, Becauſe we could not ſpeak their Language, and they might know where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we came; and they asked of her, what <hi>George Fox</hi> was; and ſhe ſaid, he was a Miniſter. And they asked <hi>wherefore ſhe came thither?</hi> ſhe ſaid, To do the Will of God, as ſhe was moved of the Lord. And they asked, <hi>How the Lord did appear unto her?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, by his Spirit. And they asked, <hi>Where ſhe was when the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto her?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, upon the Way. And they asked, <hi>Whether ſhe did ſee his Preſence, and hear his Voice?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, ſhe did hear his Voice, and ſaw his Preſence. And they asked, <hi>What he ſaid to her?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, the Lord told her ſhe muſt go over the Seas to do his Will. And they asked, <hi>How ſhe knew it was the Lord?</hi> And ſhe ſaid, He bid her go, and his living Preſence ſhould go with her, and he was faithful that had promiſed, for ſhe did feel his living Preſence. So they went away.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after they came again, and called for me, and offered me the Crucifix,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:38158:16"/> and told me, <hi>the Magiſtrate commanded me to ſwear that I would ſpeak the Truth.</hi> And I told them that I ſhould ſpeak the Truth, for I was a Witneſs for God; but I ſhould not ſwear, for a greater than the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate ſaith, <hi>Swear not at all; but let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay; for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is more cometh of evil.</hi> But ſaid they, <hi>You muſt obey the Juſtice, and he commands you to ſwear.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I ſhould obey Juſtice,</hi> but if I ſhould ſwear, I ſhould do an <hi>unjuſt thing;</hi> for (the juſt) Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all.</hi> And they asked me, <hi>Whether I did own that Chriſt that died at Jeruſalem?</hi> I anſwered, We owned the ſame Chriſt, and no other, he is the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever.</p>
            <p>And they asked me, <hi>What I would do at Jeruſalem?</hi> I ſaid, <hi>I</hi> did not know that I ſhould go there, but I ſhould go to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria;</hi> and they ſaid, <hi>What to do?</hi> and I ſaid, to do the Will of God; and if the Lord did open my mouth, I ſhould call them to Repentance, and declare to them the day of the Lord, and direct their minds from darkneſs to Light.</p>
            <p>Then they asked me, <hi>Whether I did tremble when I did preach?</hi> And I told them, I did tremble when the power of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:38158:17"/> God was upon me. And they asked, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did ſee the Lord?</hi> I ſaid, God was a Spirit, and he was ſpiritually diſcerned.</p>
            <p>That day that we were had from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſuls to the Inquiſition, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls Wife brought us meat to eat, and as ſhe paſt by me, I was ſmote with an Arrow to the heart, and I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eard a voice, ſaying, <hi>It is finiſhed, ſhe hath obtained her purpoſe.</hi> I did not taſte of her meat, but went aſide and wept bitterly. The Conſul did affirm to us the night before, that there was no ſuch thing, (as to enſnare us) intended; but it was in us as fire, and our ſouls were heavy even unto death; for many dayes before we ſaw in a Viſion of our going there, (to priſon) and we ſaid, <hi>Pilate</hi> would do the <hi>Jews</hi> a pleaſure, and waſh his hands in innocency. He required a <hi>ſign of me, if we were the Meſſengers of God;</hi> and the Lord gave me a ſign for him, that ſtuck by him while he lived. The ſame day it was he called me, and told me, the Inquiſition had ſent for us, and they had Papers from <hi>Rome,</hi> and he did hope we ſhould be ſet free, which was a lye; For he knew there was a room prepared for us. And there came a man with a black Rod, and the Chancellor and the Conſul, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:38158:17"/> had us before their Lord Inquiſitor, and he asked us, <hi>Whether we had changed our minds yet?</hi> We ſaid, Nay, we ſhould not change from the Truth. He asked, <hi>What new Light we talkt of?</hi> We ſaid, no new Light, but the ſame the <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> bare te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to. Then he ſaid. <hi>How came this Light to be loſt ever ſince the Primitive times?</hi> We ſaid, it was not loſt, men had it ſtill (in them) but they did not know it, by reaſon that the night of Apoſtacy had, and hath overſpread the Nations. Then he ſaid, <hi>If we would change our minds, and do as they would have us to do, we ſhould ſay ſo, or elſe they would uſe us as they pleaſed.</hi> We ſaid, the Will of the Lord be done. And he aroſe up and went his way with the Conſul, and left us there. And the man with the black Rod, and the Keeper, took us and put us into an inner room in the Inquiſition, which had but two little holes in it for light or air; but the glory of the Lord did ſhine round about us.</p>
            <p>After the Conſul came with tears in his eyes, and ſaid, <hi>he was as ſorry as for his own fleſh, but there was ſome hopes in time;</hi> and ſo he went away, but never had peace while he lived. He would have given up the thirty pieces of ſilver again, but it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:38158:18"/> would not be received; the Witneſs was riſen much in him, but ſlaviſh fear poſſeſt him. This was upon the ſixt day of the Week, and our ſtomacks were taken away from all meat.</p>
            <p>The next ſecond day came a Magiſtrate, two Friars, &amp; the man with the black Rod, and a Scribe, and the Keeper to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to ſit upon Judgement, and examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us apart, conc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rning our faith in Chriſt. The Magiſtrate would have had us to <hi>ſwear,</hi> and we anſwered, No; Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Swear not at all;</hi> and ſo ſaid <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle. He asked, <hi>if we would ſpeak Truth?</hi> We ſaid, Yea. He asked, <hi>Whether we did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Creed?</hi> We ſaid, we did believe in God, and in Jeſus Chriſt, which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and ſuffered at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under <hi>Pilate,</hi> and aroſe again from the dead the third day, and aſcended to his Father, and ſhall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to judge both quick and dead. He asked, <hi>How we did believe the Reſurrection?</hi> We anſwered, we did believe that the juſt and the unjuſt ſhould ariſe, according to the Scriptures. He ſaid, <hi>Do you believe in the Saints, and pray to them?</hi> We ſaid, we did believe the Communion of Saints, but we did not pray to them, but to God onely,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:38158:18"/> in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt. He asked, <hi>Whether we did believe in the Catholick Church?</hi> We ſaid, we did believe the true Church of Chriſt; but the word <hi>Catholick</hi> we have not read in Scripture. He asked, <hi>If we believed a Purgatory?</hi> We ſaid, No; but a Heaven and a Hell. The Friar ſaid, <hi>We were commanded to pray for the dead; for thoſe that were in Heaven had no need, and they that were in Hell, there is no redemption; therefore there muſt be a Purgatory.</hi> He ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>If we believed their holy Sacrament?</hi> We ſaid, we never read the Word <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Scripture. The Friar replyed, <hi>Where we did read in our Bibles,</hi> Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>it was</hi> Sacrament <hi>in theirs.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>Their holy Sacrament was Bread and Wine, which they converted into the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt, by the virtue of Chriſt.</hi> We ſaid, they did work Miracles then, for Chriſt's virtue is the ſame as it was when he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Water into Wine, at the Marriage in <hi>Canaan.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>If we did not eat the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:38158:19"/> without temporal food. He ſaid, <hi>That we did never hear Maſs.</hi> We ſaid, we did hear the voice of Chriſt, he only had the words of eternal Life, and that was ſufficient for us.

               </hi> that knew not God. He asked about our <hi>Meetings in England;</hi> And we told them the truth to their amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And they asked, <hi>Who was the Head of our Church?</hi> We ſaid, Chriſt. And they asked, <hi>What George Fox is?</hi> And we ſaid, He is a Miniſter of Chriſt. They asked, <hi>Whether he ſent us?</hi> We ſaid, No; The Lord did move us to come. The Friar ſaid, <hi>We were deceived, and had not the faith: but we have all virtues.</hi> We ſaid, that faith was the ground from whence virtues do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. They ſaid, <hi>If we would take their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, we might have our liberty; or elſe the Pope would not leave us for millions of Gold, but we ſhould loſe our ſouls and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies too.</hi> We ſaid, the Lord had provided for our ſouls, and our bodies were free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given up to ſerve the Lord. They askt us, <hi>If we did not believe Marriage was a Sacrament?</hi> We ſaid, it was an Ordinance of God. They askt us, <hi>If we did believe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:38158:19"/> men could forgive ſins?</hi> We ſaid, none could forgive ſins but God onely. They brought us that Scripture, <hi>Whoſe ſins ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in earth, ſhall be remitted in heaven.</hi> We ſaid, all Power was Gods, &amp; he could give it to whom he would (that were born of the eternal Spirit, and guided by the ſame; ſuch have power to do the Fathers Will, as I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered a Friar alſo in the City of <hi>Naples</hi>) and they were ſilent, the Power greatly working. We asked them wherein we had wronged them, that we ſhould be kept Priſoners all days of our lives; and ſaid, Our innocent blood would be required at their hands.</p>
            <p>The Friar ſaid, <hi>He would take our blood upon him, and our journey into Turky too.</hi> We told him, the time would come he would find he had enough upon him without it. They ſaid, <hi>The Pope was Chriſt's Vicar, and we were of his Church, and what he did, was for the good of our Souls.</hi> We anſwered, The Lord had not committed the charge of our ſouls to the Pope, nor to them; for he had taken them into his own poſſeſſion, glory was to his Name for ever. They ſaid, <hi>We muſt be obedient.</hi> We ſaid, we were obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the government of Chriſts Spirit. The Friar ſaid, <hi>None had the true Light
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:38158:20"/> but the Catholicks; the Light that we had; was the ſpirit of the Devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſaid, Wo to him that calleth <hi>Jeſus</hi> accurſed: Can the Devil give power over ſin and iniquity? then he would deſtroy his own kingdom. He ſaid, <hi>We were laught at, and mockt at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He ſaid, <hi>We did run about to preach, and had not the true Faith.</hi> We ſaid the true Faith is held in a pure Conſcience void of offence towards God and man; and we had the true Faith. And he ſaid, <hi>There was but one Faith, either theirs, or ours;</hi> and ask'd us <hi>which it was?</hi> We ſaid, Every one had the true Faith, that did believe in God, and in Jeſus whom he had ſent; but they that ſay they do believe, and do not keep his Commandments, are lyars, and the truth is not in them. He ſaid <hi>it was true:</hi> but he did thirſt daily for our blood, becauſe we would not turn, and urged us much about our Faith and Sacrament, to bring us under their Law; but the Lord preſerved us.</p>
            <p>They ſaid, <hi>It was impoſſible we could live long in that hot room.</hi> So the next week-day they ſate in Council; but, Oh how the ſwelling Sea did rage, and the proud waves
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:38158:20"/> did foam, even unto the clouds of Heaven! and Proclamation was made at the Priſon-Gate, we did not know the words, but the fire of the Lord flamed againſt it, <hi>[K.]</hi> my life was ſmitten, and I was in a very great agony, ſo that ſweat was as drops of blood, and the Righteous One was laid into a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher, and a great ſtone was roll'd to the door; but the Prophecy was, that he ſhould riſe again the third day, which was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. But the next day they came to ſit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Judgement again, [but I ſay, in the true Judgment they ſate not, but upon it they got up unjuſtly above the Righteous, and upon the ſame they ſate; a Child of Wiſdom may underſtand] and they brought many Propoſitions written in a Paper, but the Friar would ſuffer the Magiſtrate to propound but few to us, for fear the Light would break forth: But they ask'd, <hi>how many Friends of ours were gone forth in the Miniſtry, and into what parts?</hi> We told them what we did know. They ſaid, <hi>All that came where the Pope had any thing to do, ſhould never go back again.</hi> We ſaid, the Lord was as ſufficient for us, as he was for the Children in the fiery Furnace, and our truſt was in God. They ſaid, <hi>we were but few, and had been but a little while, but they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:38158:21"/> were many Countries, and had ſtood many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, and wrought many Miracles; and we had none.</hi> We ſaid, we had thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands at our Meetings, but none of us dare ſpeak a word, but as they are eternally mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord: and we had Miracles; The Blind receive their ſight, the Deaf do hear, and the Dumb d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He asked, <hi>Why I look'd ſo, whether my Spirit was weak?</hi> I ſaid, Nay, my body was weak, becauſe I eat no meat, [it was in their <hi>Lent] He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered me a Licence to eat fleſh.</hi> I ſaid I could not eat any thing at all, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of death were ſtrongly upon me.</p>
            <p>But three nights after the Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, about the eleventh hour, <hi>Ariſe, and put on your clothes.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>When wilt thou come, Lord?</hi> He ſaid, <hi>VVhether at midnight, or at Cock-crow, do thou watch.</hi> My Friend and I aroſe, and the Lord ſaid, <hi>Go, ſtand at the Door.</hi> And we ſtood at the door in the Power of the Lord, I did ſcarce know whether I was in the body, or out of the body. And about the twelfth hour there came many to the Priſon-Gate: We heard the Keyes, and looked when they would come in. They
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:38158:21"/> ran to and fro till the fourth hour: and the Lord ſaid, he had ſmote them with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they could not find the way. And we went to bed, where I lay night and day for twelve dayes together, faſting and ſweating, that my bed was wet, and great was our affliction.</p>
            <p>The tenth day of my faſt there came <hi>two Fryars,</hi> the <hi>Chancellor,</hi> the man with the <hi>black Rod,</hi> and a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> and the <hi>Keeper;</hi> and the <hi>Friar</hi> commanded my dear Friend to go out of the room, and he came and pull'd my hand out of the bed, and ſaid, <hi>Is the Devil ſo great in you, that you cannot ſpeak?</hi> I ſaid, Depart from me thou worker of iniquity, I know thee not; the Power of the Lord is upon me, and thou calleſt him Devil. He took his Crucifix to ſtrike me in the mouth; and I ſaid, Look here! and I asked him, Whether it were that Croſs which crucified <hi>Paul</hi> to the World, and the World unto him? And he ſaid, <hi>it was.</hi> I denied him, and ſaid, the Lord had made me a Witneſs for himſelf againſt all workers of iniquity. <hi>He bid me be obedient,</hi> and went to ſtrike me. I ſaid, Wilt thou ſtrike me? He ſaid, <hi>he would.</hi> I ſaid, Thou art out of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine, they were no ſtrikers; I
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:38158:22"/> deny thee to be any of them who went in the Name of the Lord. He ſaid, <hi>he had brought me a Phyſician in charity.</hi> I ſaid, the Lord was my Phyſician, and my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving-health. He ſaid, <hi>I ſhould be whipt, and quartered, and burnt that night in</hi> Malta, <hi>and my Mate too: wherefore did we come to teach them?</hi> I told him I did not fear, the Lord was on our ſide, and he had no power but what he had received and if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And as ſoon as they were gone, the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>The laſt Enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed, is Death;</hi> and the Life aroſe over Death, and I glorified God. The Friar went to my Friend, and told her, <hi>I called him worker of iniquity.</hi> Did ſhe, ſaid <hi>Sarah? Art thou without ſin?</hi> He ſaid <hi>he was;</hi> Then ſhe hath wronged thee. [But I ſay, the wiſe Reader may judge:] For between the eighth and ninth hour in the evening, he ſent a Drum to proclaim at the Priſon-Gate; We know not what it was, but the Fire of the Lord conſumed it. And about the fourth hour in the morning they were coming with a Drum and Guns;
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:38158:22"/> and the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>Ariſe out of thy Grave-clothes:</hi> And we aroſe, and they came up to the Gate to devour us in a moment. But the Lord lifted up his Standard with his own Spirit of Might, and made them to retreat, and they fled as duſt before the wind, praiſes and honour be given to our God for ever. I went to bed again, and the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod will ſeek the young Child's life, to deſtroy it yet again;</hi> and great was my affliction, ſo that my dear Fellow-Labourer in the Work of God, did look every hour when I ſhould depart the body for many dayes together; and we did look every hour when we ſhould be brought to the ſtake day and night for ſeveral weeks, and <hi>Iſaac</hi> was freely offered up: but the Lord ſaid, he had provided a Ram in the buſh.</p>
            <p>Afterwards the Friar came again with his Phyſician; I told him, that I could not take any thing, unleſs I was moved of the Lord. He ſaid, <hi>we muſt never come forth of that Room while we lived, and we might thank God and him it was no worſe, for it was like to be worſe.</hi> We ſaid, if we had died, we had died as innocent as ever did Servants of the Lord. He ſaid it was well we were innocent. They did (alſo) look
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:38158:23"/> ſtill when I would die. The Friar bid my Friend <hi>take notice what torment I would be in at the hour of death; thouſands of Devils</hi> (he ſaid) <hi>would fetch my ſoul to Hell.</hi> She ſaid, ſhe did not fear any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>And he asked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>if I did not think it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the Elders of the Church to pray over the ſick?</hi> I ſaid, Yea, ſuch as were eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved of the Spirit of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The laſt day of my Faſt I began to be an hungry, but was afraid to eat, the Enemy was ſo ſtrong; but the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>If thine Enemy hunger, féed him; if he thirſt, give him drink: in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire upon his head. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.</hi> I did eat, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, and glorified God; and in the midſt of our extremity the Lord ſent his holy Angels to comfort us, ſo that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced and magnified God; and in the time of our great tryal, the Sun and Earth did mourn viſibly three dayes, and the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:38158:23"/> horror of Death and pains of Hell was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me; the Sun was darkned, the Moon was turned into blood, and the Stars did fall from Heaven, and there was great tribulation ten dayes, ſuch as never was from the beginning of the world; and then I did ſee the Son of man coming in the Clouds with Power and great Glory, triumphing over his Enemies; the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens were on fire, and the Elements did melt with fervent heat, and the Trumpet ſounded out of <hi>Sion,</hi> and an Allarm was ſtruck up in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and all the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God were called to the great Day of Battel of the Lord. And I ſaw a great Wonder in Heaven, the Woman cloathed with the Sun, and had the Moon under her feet, and a Crown of twelve Stars upon her head, and ſhe travelled in pain ready to be delivered of a Man-child; and there was a great Dragon ſtood ready to devour the Man-child as ſoon as it was born: and there was given to the Woman two wings of a great Eagle to carry her into the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, where ſhe ſhould be nouriſhed for a time, times, and half a time; and the Dragon caſt a Flood out of his mouth, &amp;c. And I ſaw War in Heaven, <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels againſt the <hi>Dragon</hi> and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:38158:24"/> and the Lamb and his Army did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them. And there was a Trumpet ſounded in Heaven, and I heard a Voice ſaying to me, <hi>The City is divided into thrée parts.</hi> And I heard another Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounding, and I looked and ſaw an Angel go down into a great Pool of water, and I heard a Voice ſaying unto me, <hi>VVhoſoever goeth down next after the troubling of the waters, ſhall be healed of whatſoever Diſeaſe he hath.</hi> And I heard another Trumpet ſounding, and I heard a Voice ſaying, <hi>Babylon is fallen, is fallen, Babylon the great is fallen.</hi> And I looked and ſaw the ſmoak of her torment how it did aſcend; and <hi>I</hi> heard another Trumpet ſounding, and <hi>I</hi> heard a Voice ſaying, <hi>Rejoyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your Reward in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: for he that is mighty hath magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied you, and Holy is his Name: And from henceforth all generations ſhall call you bleſſed.</hi> And <hi>I</hi> heard another Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet ſounding in Heaven, and I heard a Voice ſaying unto me, <hi>Behold!</hi> and <hi>I</hi> looked, and <hi>I</hi> ſaw <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Hoſt purſuing the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and he and his Hoſt were drowned in the Sea.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:38158:24"/>
            <p>Dear Friends and People, whatſoever I have written, it is not becauſe it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the Scripture, or that I have heard of ſuch things; but in obedience to the Lord I have written the things which <hi>I</hi> did hear, ſee, taſted and handled of the good Word of God, to the praiſe of his Name for ever.</p>
            <p>And all this time my dear Siſter in Chriſt Jeſus, was in as great affliction as I (in a manner) to ſee my ſtrong Travel night and day; yet ſhe was kept in the patience, and would willingly have given me up to death, that I might have been at reſt; yet ſhe would have been left in as great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, wo and miſery, as ever was any poor captive for the Lord's truth; for they did work night and day with their Divinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Inchantments and Temptations, thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereby to bring us under their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but the Lord prevented them every way, ſo that great was their rage; and they came often with their Phyſician, and ſaid it was in charity: I askt them whether they did keep us in that hot room to kill us, and bring us a Phyſitian to make us alive.</p>
            <p>The Fryar ſaid, <hi>The Inquiſitor would loſe his Head if he ſhould take us thence; and it was better to keep us there, than to kill us.</hi>

            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:38158:25"/>
            <p>The Room was ſo hot and ſo cloſe, that we were fain to riſe often out of our bed, and lie down at a chink of their door for Air to fetch breath; and with the fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and the heat without, our skin was like ſheeps Leather, and the Hair did fall off our heads, and we did fail often. Our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Burthens were ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We did write to the Inquiſitor, and laid before him our Innocency, and our Faithfulneſs, in giving our Teſtimony for the Lord amongſt them: And I told him, if it were our Blood they did thurſt after, they might take it any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, as well as to ſmother us up in that hot room. So he ſent the Fryar, and he took away our <hi>Ink-horns</hi> (they had our <hi>Bibles</hi> before). We asked why they took away our goods? They ſaid, <hi>It was all theirs, and our Lives too, if they would.</hi> We asked, how we had forfeited our lives unto them; they ſaid, <hi>For bringing Books and Papers.</hi> We ſaid, if there were any thing in them that was not true, they might
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:38158:25"/> write againſt it. They ſaid, <hi>They did ſcorn to write to Fools and Aſſes that did not know true Latine.</hi> And they told us, <hi>the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor would have us ſeparated, becauſe I was weak, and I ſhould go into a cooler room;</hi> but <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhould abide there; I took her by the arm, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath joyned us together, and wo be to them that ſhould part us.</hi> I ſaid, I rather chuſe to dye there with my Friend, than to part from her. He was ſmitten, and went away, and came no more in five weeks; and the door was not opened in that time. Then they came again to part us, but I was ſick, and broken out from head to foot. They ſent for a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, and he ſaid, <hi>We muſt have air, or elſe we muſt dye.</hi> So the Lord compelled them to go to the Inquiſitor, and he gave order <hi>for the door to be ſet open ſix hours in a day:</hi> they did not part us till Ten weeks after: But oh the dark clouds and the ſharp ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers the Lord did carry us through! Death it ſelf had been better than to have parted in that place. They ſaid, <hi>we corrupted each other, and that they thought when we were parted, we would have bowed to them.</hi> But they found we were more ſtronger after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards than we were before; the Lord our God did fit us for every condition. They
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:38158:26"/> came and brought a Scourge of ſmall Hemp, and asked us, <hi>If we would have any of it.</hi> They ſaid, <hi>They did whip themſelves till the blood did come.</hi> We ſaid, that could not reach the Devil, he ſate upon the heart. They ſaid, <hi>All the men and women of</hi> Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>were for us, if we would be Catholicks, for there would be none like unto us.</hi> We ſaid, the Lord had changed us into that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Upon a Firſt day of the week, we were faſting and waiting upon the Lord till the ſecond hour (after mid-day) and the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars came and commanded us, <hi>In the Name of the Lord to kneel down with them to prayer.</hi> We ſaid, we could not pray but as we were moved of the Lord. They commanded
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:38158:26"/> us the ſecond time. Then they kneeled down by our bed ſide, and prayed, and when they had done, they ſaid, <hi>They had tryed our Spirits, now they knew what Spirit we were of.</hi> We told them, they could not know our Spirits, unleſs their minds were turned to the Light of the Lord Jeſus in their Conſciences. The Engliſh Fryar was wroth, and ſhewed us his <hi>Crucifix,</hi> and bid us <hi>look there.</hi> We ſaid, the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not make to thy ſelf the Likeneſs of any thing that is in heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water under the earth; thou ſhalt not bow to them, nor worſhip them, but I the Lord thy God only.</hi> He was ſo mad, he called for the Irons to chain <hi>Sarah,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe ſpake ſo boldly to him: She bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her head, and ſaid to him, <hi>Not only my feet, but my hands and my neck alſo for the Teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> His wrath was ſoon appeaſed, and he ſaid, <hi>He would do us any good he could; he did ſee what we did was not in malice:</hi> the power had broken him down for that preſent. They came to us often, ſaying, <hi>If you would do but a little, you ſhould be ſet at liberty; but you will do nothing at all, but are againſt every thing.</hi> We ſaid, we are againſt nothing that is of God, but would do any thing that might make for God's glory.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:38158:27"/>
            <p>Many did think we ſhould not have been heard nor ſeen after we were in the <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;</hi> but the Lord did work wonderfully for us, and his Truth: For they new built the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and there were many <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers</hi> for a year and a half, and the great Men came to ſee the building; and we were carried forth with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ower to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, not fearing the face of man; the Lord was our ſtrength: But behold they threatned us with <hi>Irons</hi> and <hi>Halters,</hi> for preaching the Light ſo boldly; and they ſaid, <hi>None ought to preach but Prelates to a Biſhop</hi> (as they uſe to ſay in <hi>England.</hi>) Now their <hi>Lord Inquiſitor</hi> (ſo called) and the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates</hi> were kept moderate towards us, and gave order, <hi>we ſhould have Ink and Paper to write to England.</hi> But we were hindered ſtill; and we do believe they would have ſet us at liberty, had it not been for the Fryars; it was they that wrote againſt us ſtill to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and to the <hi>Inquiſitor;</hi> and we told them ſo. They ſought three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a year to part us, before they could bring it to paſs; and when they did part us, they prepared a Bed for <hi>Sarah,</hi> and their own <hi>Catholicks</hi> lay upon the Boards, that had not beds of their own. When we were
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:38158:27"/> parted, the Lord would not ſuffer me to keep any money; I knew not the mind of God in it. Their Fryars came and ſaid, <hi>We ſhould never ſee one anothers faces again, but the Inquiſitor ſhould ſend me my food.</hi> But the Lord would not ſuffer him to ſend it. <hi>Sarah</hi> did ſend me ſuch as ſhe could get, near three weeks time. Then the Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar came and askt me, <hi>what I did want?</hi> I ſaid, one to waſh my Linnen, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hot to eat; I was weak. He ſent to <hi>Sarah</hi> to know <hi>if ſhe would do it for me.</hi> She ſaid ſhe would. And by that means we did hear of each other every day. The Fryar ſaid, <hi>You may free your ſelf of miſery when you will; you may make your ſelf a Catholick, and have your freedom to go where you will.</hi> I told him, I might make my ſelf a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and have a name that I did live, when I was dead; and ſaid, he had Catholicks enough already; he ſhould bring ſome of them to the Light in their Conſciences, that they might <hi>ſtand in awe, and ſin not.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>He would loſe one of his fingers if we would be Catholicks.</hi> I ſaid, it was <hi>Babylon</hi> that was built with <hi>Blood; <hi>Sion</hi>
               </hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed through <hi>Iudgment.</hi> They would have had me to ſet a Picture at my beds head, for a repreſentation. I askt them if

The Fryar ſaid, <hi>They did, but they had Traditions too.

I</hi> denied that, and ſaid, We never read any ſuch thing in Scripture; for <hi>Peter,</hi> Chriſt's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:38158:28"/> Apoſtle, had no money to build Altars; he himſelf did offer Sacrifice upon the Altars made without hands. And he ſaid, <hi>We were but a few, and riſen up but late, and they were many, and had ſtood Fourteen hundred years; and God was a lyar if they had not the true Faith; for he had confirmed it to them by a thouſand miracles.

He askt if we were? <hi>then all the World,</hi> ſaid he. <hi>I</hi> ſaid, Our Faith was from the beginning. <hi>Abel</hi> was of our Church; and <hi>the World by Wiſdom did not know God.</hi> He went to <hi>Sarah</hi> with the ſame Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſhe told him alſo, that <hi>Abel</hi> was of our Church.

            <p>So they went from one to another, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to entangle us in our talk; but we were guided by one Spirit, and ſpake one and

He went and told the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> of it, and he laught at him: I ſaw it, and felt it in that which is Eternal. I was moved out of that Room before he came again; and when he came; he brought one of the Inquiſitors men with him, and two very good Hens, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord Inquiſitor had ſent them in love to me.</hi> I ſaid, his love I did receive, but I

He ſaid, <hi>It was for the good of our Souls he kept us in priſon.</hi> I told him, our Souls were out of the <hi>Inquiſitors</hi> reach, or his either: He told me before, <hi>If we had not been going to preach, we might have gone where we would.</hi> I askt him, What ſhould our ſouls have done then? and why their love ſhould extend more to us, than to their own Family? They could not charge us with Sin, and they did commit all manner of Sin; they might put them into the Inquiſition, and bid turn.</p>
            <p>He ſaid again, <hi>We had not the true Faith,</hi> and ſhewed me his Crucifix, and askt me, <hi>If I thought he did worſhip that?</hi> I askt him what he did do with it? He ſaid, <hi>It was a
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:38158:30"/> Repreſentation.</hi> I ſaid, it did not repreſent Chriſt, for he was the expreſs Image of his Father's Glory, which is Light and Life. I ſaid, if he could put any life in any of his images, he might bring them to me. And <hi>I</hi> askt him what <hi>Repreſentation Daniel</hi> had in the <hi>Lyons Den;</hi> or <hi>Jonas</hi> in the <hi>Whales belly;</hi> they cryed unto the Lord, and he delivered them. He ſaid, <hi>I talkt like a mad woman, I talkt ſo much againſt their Idols.</hi> He was in a rage, and ſaid, <hi>He would give me to the Devil. I</hi> bid him give his own, <hi>I</hi> am the Lord's.

He ſtood up and opened his mouth; and <hi>I</hi> ſtood up to him, and denied him in the Name of the Lord, the living God, and ſaid, he had no power over me. And away he went to <hi>Sarah</hi> with the Hens, and told her, <hi>that I was ſick, and the Lord Inquiſitor had ſent two Hens, and I would be glad to eat a piece of one if ſhe would dreſs one of them preſently, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to morrow.</hi> [Mark this Deceiver, this Lyar!] But ſhe ſtanding in the Counſel of the Lord, anſwered him accordingly as <hi>I</hi> did; and he carried them away again. We did not dare to take them, the Lord did forbid us. He ſaid, <hi>You would fain be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:38158:31"/> burned, becauſe you would make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you did love God ſo well as to ſuffer in that kind.</hi> I ſaid, I did not deſire to be burnt; but if the Lord did call me to it, I did believe he would give me power to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go it for his Truth; and if every hair of my head was a body, I could offer them up all for the Teſtimony of Jeſus. He came twice <hi>to know whether I had not been inſpired of the Holy Ghoſt to be a Catholick, ſince I came into the Inquiſition.</hi> I ſaid, No; he ſaid, <hi>We were;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>We called the Spirit of the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of the Devil.</hi> We ſaid, the Spirit of the Holy Ghoſt in us will reſiſt the Devil. We told him, the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt was never wrought in the Will of man, nor in man's time, but in the Will of God, and in God's time. He asked, <hi>How we did know a clean from an unclean Spirit?</hi> We ſaid, An unclean ſpirit did burden the Seed of God, and dam up the Springs of Life; and a clean Spirit would open the Spring of Life, and refreſh the Seed; it was a Riddle to him, but he ſaid it was true: he would aſſent to pure Truth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</p>
            <p>We asked him, Whether every man and woman did not ſtand guilty before God of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:38158:31"/> all the Sins they ever committed before Regeneration? He ſaid, <hi>Yea.</hi> And he did confeſs all their Learning and Languages (in their places) was but to ſerve the Lord. We told him, all their Praying, Preaching and Crouding, was no more accepted than <hi>Cain's</hi> Sacrifice, unleſs they were moved of the eternal Spirit of the Lord. We askt him, If he that was in them, was greater than he that was in us; and why they had not overcome us all that time? We were very ſenſible of their workings day and night: He ſaid, <hi>Becauſe we reſiſted ſtill.</hi> We askt him for our Bibles. He ſaid, <hi>We ſhould never ſee them again, they were falſe.</hi> We ſaid, if they were conjuring Books, they had no warrant from the Lord to take them from us.</p>
            <p>They alwayes came two Fryars at a time, and they would fall down and howl, and wiſh bitter wiſhes upon themſelves if they were not in the Truth. We would deny them, and preach Truth to them, the Light of the Lord Jeſus in the Conſciences of every one, to lead them to a pure life; and did ask them where the pure and holy Life was, and what all of them did do, that the People did live in ſin and all manner of wickedneſs? and whether Words and

He was as bloody a fiery Serpent, as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was born of a woman, and did ſtrike as hard at our Lives, and would hold up his hand often to ſtrike us, but had never the power, he would quickly be cut down, that he would ſay, <hi>we were good women, and he would do us any good.</hi> He was compelled to work for us ſometimes, and would ſay it was for God's ſake, and would have us thank him for it. We would tell him, thoſe that did any thing for God, did not look for a reward from man. He ſaid, <hi>We were the worſt of all creatures, and we ſhould be uſed worſe than any; the Turks, Arminians, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants and Lutherans ſhould be uſed better than we.</hi> We ſaid, the pure Life was ever counted the worſt, and we muſt ſuffer; we were the Lord's, and could truſt him; let him do what he would with us, we did not fear any evil tydings; we were ſetled and grounded in the Truth; and the more they did perſecute us, the more ſtronger we did grow; We were bold and valiant for God's Tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

            <p>The Fryars went to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and told her, <hi>if ſhe would, ſhe ſhould go forth of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſay nothing, nor do nothing.</hi> She ſaid, ſhe would upon that account. <hi>He</hi> ſaid, they would come in the morning, and ſo they did; but the Lord ſaw their deceit, and fore-warned <hi>Sarah,</hi> and bid her mind <hi>Eſau, who ſold his Birth-right for a morſel of meat; and</hi> Judas, <hi>that betrayed his Maſter for thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pieces of Silver:</hi> That when they came, ſhe (was ſtrengthned againſt them, and) ſaid, ſhe ſtood in the Counſel of God, and could take up nothing in her own will; they had not power to have her forth.

            </p>
            <p>But there was a poor <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, heard that <hi>Sarah</hi> was in a Room with a window next the Street, it was high; he got up, and ſpake a few words to her, and they came violently and hall'd him down, and caſt him into Priſon upon Life and Death: And the Friars came to know of us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had brought any Letters. We ſaid, No; I did not ſee him. They ſaid, they did think he would be hang'd for it. He was one that they had taken from the <hi>Turks,</hi> and made a Catholick of him. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:38158:33"/> wrote a few lines to me of it, and ſaid, She did think the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Friars were the chief actors of it (we had a private way to ſend to each other.) I wrote to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and after my Salutation, I ſaid, Whereas ſhe ſaid the Friars were the chief actors, ſhe might be ſure of that, for they did haſten to fill up their meaſures; but I believe the Lord will preſerve the poor man for his love; I am made to ſeek the Lord for him with tears: and I deſired ſhe would ſend him ſomething once a day, if the Keeper would carry it; and I told her of the glorious Manifeſtations of God to my Soul, for her comfort, ſo that I was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with Love, and my Beloved was the chiefeſt of ten thouſands; and how I did not fear the face of any man, though I did feel their arrows, for my Phyſician is nigh me; and how I was waiting upon the Lord, and ſaw our ſafe return into <hi>England,</hi> and I was talking with <hi>G.

I bid her take heed, the Light would diſcover it; and many more things, let it come under what cover it would.</p>
            <p>And this Paper came to the Friars hands,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:38158:33"/> by what means we could never tell, but as the Light did ſhew us, the Lord would have it ſo; it ſmote the <hi>Friar,</hi> that he was tormented many dayes; and he tranſlated it into <hi>Italian,</hi> and laid it before their Lord <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> and got the <hi>Inquiſitor's</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and came to me with both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in his hand, and askt me, <hi>If I could read it?

So the Lieutenant took my Ink and threw it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; and they were ſmitten as if they

            <p>They went to <hi>Sarah,</hi> and told her, <hi>that I had honeſtly confeſt all, and that ſhe was beſt to confeſs too; and threatned her with a Halter, and to take away a Bed and Trunk, and her Money, to have half of it for me.</hi> She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhe might not fend to me any more.

            <p>The Lord was not wanting to us at any time, for Power nor Words to ſtop the mouths of gain-ſayers of his Truth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Revelations nor Viſions; Praiſes be to his Name for ever: He kept us in our weakeſt condition, bold for his <hi>Truth,</hi> declaring againſt all ſin and wickedneſs, ſo that many were convinced, but did not dare to own it, for fear of <hi>Faggot</hi> and <hi>Fire.</hi> There were none that had any thing to ſay

There were none did come into the Inquiſition, but the Judgments of the Lord would be upon them, ſo that they would cry and foam, and ſend for a Phyſitian many of them. The unclean ſpirits would cry out as much as ever they did againſt Jeſus, and would gnaſh vvith their teeth vvhen we vvere at prayer: there vvas a Friar, and other great Men, the Friar vvould run as if he had been at his wits end, and call to the Keeper, and he vvould run for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Frier, and he vvould go to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor for counſel, and ſometimes they vvould ſend him word they ſhould have a remedy, I ſhould be ſent to <hi>Rome;</hi> and ſometimes the Friars would come, but had not power to ſay any thing to me of it. The Lord did ſay unto us, <hi>Lift up your Voice like the noiſe of a Trumpet, and ſound forth my Truth like the ſhout of a King.</hi> There vvas one that Life was riſen in him, but they vvere upon him as Eagles, till they had deſtroyed him; he did undergo terrible Judgments all the time he vvas in the Inquiſition.</p>
            <p>Our Money ſerved us a year and ſeven weeks; and vvhen it vvas almoſt gone,

            <p>And then the Lord did take away our Stomacks; vve did eat but little for three or four Weeks; and then the Lord called us to faſting for eleven dayes together, but it vvas ſo little, that the Friars came and ſaid, <hi>That it was impoſſible that Creatures could live with ſo little meat,</hi> as they did ſee vve did for ſo long time together; and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, <hi>what we would do?</hi> And ſaid, their <hi>Lord Inquiſitor ſaid, We might have any thing we would.</hi> We ſaid, we muſt vvait to know the mind of God, vvhat he vvould have us to do.

The Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>Thou mayeſt as freely eat, as if thou hadſt wrought for it with thy hands; I will ſanctifie it to thee <hi>through the Croſs.</hi>
               </hi> And he ſaid to <hi>Sarah, Thou ſhalt eat the

But the Lord did torment him and all the reſt, till they did bring us ſuch things as were fitting.

            <p>A little before the Fryar went to <hi>Rome,</hi> he came to the Inquiſition Chamber with a Scribe, to write concerning us, to carry it with him; I ſaw him, as God would have it; the Lord ſaid, <hi>There is thy deadly foe.</hi> They were writing part of three days; and when they had ended it, the Lord would not let me eat till the Scribe did come where I was, that I might pronounce wo againſt it, and defie it, which I did do in the Name of the Lord, and it did wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with all the reſt.

He was ſworn upon his Oath to protect the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and their Ruler bid him let us go about our buſineſs, and ſaid, <hi>we were honeſt Women;</hi> and then he might have let us go before we were under the black Rod.</p>
            <p>Then he went to <hi>Sarah</hi> with the Dollar; ſhe told him ſhe could not take the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but if he had a Letter for us, ſhe ſhould be free to receive that. He ſaid, <hi>he had not any.</hi> He askt her, <hi>What ſhe did want?</hi> She ſaid, the Lord was her Shepherd, ſhe could not want any good thing; but ſhe did long for her freedom. He ſaid, <hi>That,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:38158:38"/> you may have in time.</hi> He told us, <hi>We ſhould have Ink and Paper to write,</hi> but when he was gone, they would not let us. The next time we heard of him, he was dead. We could have rejoyced if he had died for Righteouſneſs ſake; for the Lord delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the death of a ſinner.</p>
            <p>The Friar was gone to <hi>Rome,</hi> and they ſaid, <hi>he muſt ſtay there till we came.</hi> There was great working to ſend us thither, but the Lord did prevent them, that they could not ſend us thither. Then the Lord did work to bring us together again after ſo long time we had been parted. There were five doors between us with Locks and Bolts, but the Keeper had not power to make them faſt, but as <hi>Sarah</hi> could undo them to come where I could ſee her, but could not ſpeak to her, for there were them that did watch us night and day; yet ſhe being moved of the Lord, did come to my door by night; ſhe muſt come by the Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars door, he and the Doctor of Law were together, and they did ſet a trap to take her in; many did watch about the Priſon, and would complain. Then ſhe was lockt up again; but they had no peace in that, till the doors were open again; then we did ſit in the ſight of each other, to wait upon
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:38158:39"/> the Lord, ſo that our voices were heard far; the Magiſtrates would hear and bow to it ſometime; then the complainers were weary, and did work to have us brought to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and we did wait and pray, and the Magiſtrates would come in and look upon us many times, but would ſay nothing to us.</p>
            <p>There were of divers Nations brought into the Inquiſition, Priſoners; and the Friars, and the reſt that were great, would go in their way to make Chriſtians of them, and we were made to ſtand up againſt them and their ways, and deny them in the Name of the Lord, and to declare the Truth to the ſimple-hearted continually, if we did ſuffer death for it. We could not endure to hear the Name of the Lord blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed, nor his pure way of Truth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, nor the ignorant deceived. They did write all they underſtood of what we ſpake, and ſent it to the Court-Chamber before the Inquiſitor and Magiſtrates, but the Lord did blaſt it with the mildews of his wrathful indignation, and burnt it up with the brightneſs of his Son, and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced in our God; but ſtill our burdens continued very heavy, and our righteous ſouls were vexed with the filthy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked, and the pure Seed of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:38158:39"/> God was preſt from day to day, that our ſpirits did mourn, and our hearts were grieved becauſe of the hardneſs of their hearts, and their rebellion againſt their Maker, who was ſo gracious to them, to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them ſo long in all their abominations, and waited to be gracious to them, and knockt at the door of their hearts, calling for <hi>Juſtice, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Humility;</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Oppreſſion, Cruelty,</hi> and <hi>Self-exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> notwithſtanding the Lord did ſtrive ſo much with them, and ſent ſo many unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niable Truths, and infallible Teſtimonies of the coming of his Son to Judgement, and ſo clear a manifeſtation of the way to eternal Salvation, given forth of his own mouth, by his eternal Spirit, and having us for an example, who were kept by his Power and Holineſs; they had not a jot nor tittle againſt us, but for righteouſneſs ſake, though they had winnowed and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned us ſo long: glory, honour and praiſes be given to our God for ever.</p>
            <p>O they would not let us know of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ship that came into the Harbour, as near as they could, but the Lord would make it manifeſt to us; we had a great working and ſtriving in our Bodies, but we knew not what it meant; the arrows of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:38158:40"/> the Wicked did fly, ſo that my ſoul was plunged and overwhelmed from head to feet, and the terrors of the unrighteous had taken hold of us, and the flames of Hell compaſſed us about; then the Lord ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto me in a dream, and ſaid, <hi>There were two Engliſh Friends in the City, which did plead for our Liberty in our behalf, and he had taken all fear away from them, and made them bold.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in a little while after the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſent for us forth, and askt us, <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we were ſick?</hi> or, <hi>whether we did want any thing?</hi> and were very tender to us, and ſaid, <hi>we ſhould write to England,</hi> and bid the Scribe give us <hi>Ink and Paper;</hi> he ſaid he would, but he was ſo wicked he did not. They did not tell us of any <hi>Engliſh</hi> that were there; but there was one <hi>Francis Steward</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> a Captain of a Ship, and a <hi>Friar</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which came to the City together, (for what we know) and they did take great paines for us, and went to their Ruler, and the Inquiſitor, and to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Magiſtrates and Friars, and the new <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul with them, and wrought much amongſt them, that all were willing to let us go, ſave the Inquiſitor, they ſaid; and he ſaid, <hi>He could not free us without an
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:38158:40"/> Order from the Pope.</hi> But we had many heavy enemies beſides, which would not be ſeen; but they obtained the favour to come and ſpeak with us, which was a great thing in ſuch a place.</p>
            <p>They ſent for us to the Court-Chamber, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul askt us, <hi>If we were willing to go back to England?</hi> We ſaid, if it were the will of God we might. The Captain ſpake to us with tears in his eyes, and told us what they had done for us, but could not prevail; It is this Inquiſitor (ſaid he) the reſt were made free; you have preached among theſe people he ſaid. We told him, we were called upon the Teſtimony of our Conſcience, and the Truth that we have witneſſed forth among them, we ſhould ſtand to maintain with our blood. He ſaid, <hi>If they could get us off, he would freely give us our paſſage, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for us,</hi> and the Veſſel was his own. We told him, his love was as well accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Lord, as if he did carry us. He offered us money; he ſaw the Lord would not ſuffer us to take any. He took our Names. We told them they took us out of our way, and put us into the Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and bid us change our minds; and we could not, the Lord had changed us into
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:38158:41"/> that which changed not, if they would burn us to aſhes, or chop us as Herbs to the Pot. The Friar ſaid, <hi>We did not work;</hi> which was falſe, we had Work of our own, and did work as we were able. We told him, our Work and Maintenance was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> And they ſaid, <hi>It was true.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>We would not accept of the Inquiſitors Diet.</hi> We did not know who did prepare for us; we did receive our meat as we had freedom in the Lord. Then he ſaid, <hi>We had ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long enough, and too long, but we ſhould have our freedom in few days, and that they would ſend to the Pope for an Order.</hi> And there were many Engliſh Ships that way; but the Captain ſaw it was a very hard thing, ſo that it grieved him to the heart: He prayed God to comfort us, and he went away, and we do beſeech God to bleſs and preſerve him, unto everlaſting Life, and never to let him nor his, go without a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from him, for his love: he did venture himſelf exceedingly in that place. But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was gone, they aroſe up againſt us with one accord: The Inquiſitor came up into a Tower, and lookt down upon us as if he would have eaten us, and they did try us for our lives again, and did ſhut up our doors many Weeks, we could not
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:38158:41"/> tell for what; at length the Inquiſitor came into the Tower again, and <hi>Sarah</hi> was moved to call to him, to have the door opened for us to go down into the Court to waſh our clothes. Then he gave command for the door to be opened once a week; and in a little while 'twas open ever day. But great was our affliction indeed; and ſhe told him if we were the Popes Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we would appeal to the Pope, and he ſhould ſend us to him. But them in the Priſon with us, eſpecially the Friar, were mortal Enemies to us, but yet they would have fed us with the choiceſt of their meat, and would gladly give us whole Bottels of wine, if we would receive it, and were greatly troubled becauſe we did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to eat and drink with them, and did perſecute us exceedingly; but the Lord did viſit them with his dreadful Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Friar was tormented night and day, his body did periſh, the Doctors and Chyrurgeons did follow him a long time.</p>
            <p>And there were two or three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships there, came into harbour, and <hi>Sarah</hi> ſaw the coming of them in a Viſion of the night, and there was great pleading for us, that we ſaw; but ſhe heard a Voice, ſaying, <hi>We could not go now.</hi> So we were mad:
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:38158:42" rendition="simple:additions"/> willing to wait the Lords time.</p>
            <p>Then they ſent for us forth when the Ships were gone, and askt us, <hi>If we would be Catholicks?</hi> And we ſaid, we were true Chriſtians, and had received the Spirit of Chriſt, and he that had not the Spirit of Chriſt was none of his. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul told us of the Ships, and ſaid, <hi>They would not let us go unleſs we would be Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks; and that we muſt ſuffer more impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment yet,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he did what he could for us.</hi> One of the Magiſtrates ſhewed us the Croſs; We told them, and ſaid, We did take up the Croſs of Chriſt daily, which is the great Power of God to crucifie ſin and iniquity: ſo we told them that one of their <hi>Fathers</hi> did promiſe us our liberty. We did think that Friar was too tender-hearted to ſtay among them; he did take a great deal of pains for us (the Captain ſaid) We told him, he would never have cauſe to repent it; the bleſſing of God would be upon him for any thing he ſhould do for us; for we were the Servants of the living God; and he promiſed us our freedoms in a little time.</p>

                  <hi>O</hi> Dearly beloved Friends, Fathers, and Elders, and Pillars of Gods Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Houſe, and Brethren and Siſters in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the meaſure of Love and Life of our God, do we ſalute you all, and do embrace you in that which is Eternal, and we do greatly rejoyce, and glorify the Name of our Heavenly Father; that he hath counted us worthy to be partakers of the death and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his bleſſed Son, with you; though we be the leaſt of God's Flock, yet we are of the true Fold, whereof Chriſt Jeſus is ſhepherd; and he hath had as tender a care over us, as he hath had of any of his Lambs which he hath called forth in this the day of his Power; and hath carried us through, and over as great afflictions as moſt of our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and ſufferers for his Name, both in mockings, ſcoffings, ſcornings, reproaches, ſtripes, contradictions, perils at Land, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils at Sea, fiery tryals, cruel threatnings,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:38158:43"/> grief of heart, ſorrow of ſoul, heats and colds, faſtings and watchings, fears within, and frightings without, terrible temptations and perſecutions, and dreadful impriſonments and buffettings of Satan; yet in all theſe our tryals the Lord was very gracious unto us, and not abſent himſelf from us, neither ſuffered his faithfulneſs to fail us, but did bear us up, and keep us from fainting in the midſt of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity; we had not another to make our moan to, but the Lord alone, neither could we expect a drop of mercy, favour or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but what he did diſtil from his living Preſence, and work by his own ſtrength; for we ſat one in one room, and the other in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, near a year; as Owls in deſerts, and as People forſaken in ſolitary places; then did we enjoy the preſence of the Lord, and did behold the brightneſs of his glory, and we did ſee you our dear Friends, in the Light of Jeſus, and did behold your order; and ſtedfaſtneſs of your Faith and Love to all Saints, and were refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the faithful hearted, and felt the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues of Love and Life which did ſtream from the hearts of thoſe that were wholly joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Fountain, and were made ſenſible of the benefit of your Prayers.</p>
               <p>O the ſorrows, the mournings, the tears! but thoſe that ſow in tears, ſhall reap in joy.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:38158:43" rendition="simple:additions"/> A true ſorrow begets a true joy, and a true Croſs, a true Crown: For when our ſorrows did abound, the Love of God did abound much more; the deeper the ſorrows, the greater the joyes; the greater the Croſs, the weightier the Crown.</p>
               <p>Dear Friends and Brethren, marvel not that Iſrael is not gathered, our Judgement re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains with the Lord, and ſo do our Labours; for it was not for want of travel, nor pain, nor love to their ſouls; for we could have been contented to have fed upon the Graſs on the ground, ſo we might have had our freedom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: For, had it not been for the great oppoſition, they would have followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us as Chickens after a Hen, both great and ſmall. But oh the ſwelling Seas, the raging and foaming Waves, ſtormy Winds and Floods, and deep Waters, and high Mountains and Hills, hard Rocks, rough Ways, and crooked Paths, tall Cedars, ſtrong Oaks, fruitleſs Trees, and corrupted ones, that cumber the ground, and hinder the righteous Seed to be ſown, and the noble Plants from being planted! Oh! they ſhut up the Kingdom againſt the ſimple heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and hide the key of Knowledge from the innocent Ones, and will not enter into the Kingdom themſelves, nor ſuffer them that would enter, but ſtir up the Magiſtrates to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:38158:44"/> form carnal Weapons, thinking to prevent the Lord of taking to him his Inheritance, and to diſpoſſeſs his Son, who is Heir of all, that he might not have a dwelling-place among them, nor a habitation nigh them; becauſe that his Light will diſcover their darkneſs, and his brightneſs will burn up all their abominations, and mar their beauty, and ſtain their glory, their pomp and their pride, that it may periſh as the untimely Figs, and fall as the Flower of the Field, and wither as the Graſs upon the houſe-top. Oh! the Belly of Hell, the Jaws of Satan, the whole Myſtery of Iniquity is at the height, and all manner of Abominations that make deſolate, ſtands where it ought not, and is upholden by a Law; That upon pain of death none muſt ſpeak againſt it, nor walk con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to it. But praiſes to our God, he carried us forth to declare againſt it daily. Oh! the blind guides, the ſeducing ſpirits, that do cauſe the people to erre, and compel them to worſhip the Beaſt and his Image, and have his mark in their fore-heads, and in their hands, and to bow to Pictures and painted Walls, and to worſhip the things of their own hands, and to fall down to that which their own fingers have faſhioned, and will not ſuffer them to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Sion</hi> upon pain of death, nor to walk to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> upon pain of Faggot and

They do not know the Scriptures. Their Bibles would grieve any honeſt heart to behold them, becauſe of the corruption. They ſaid, <hi>our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were falſe.</hi> I asked wherein? The Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſaid, <hi>Maccabees was not in them.</hi> I ſaid, if any were taken from them, yet the reſt might be pure; but if any were added to them,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:38158:45"/> then they were corrupted. He askt me, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did not think it meet for every one to bow at the Name of Jeſus. I ſaid, Yea. He ſaid, <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and bid me fall down, or bow my body. I told him, My heart and whole body was bowed under the Name of Jeſus; but I ſhould not ſtoop to his will, nor any man's elſe: He that departeth from Iniquity, boweth to the Name of Jeſus; but thoſe that live in Sin and Wickedneſs, do not ſtoop to the Son of God. And he told me, they ſtood in the ſame Power the Apoſtles did, and were guided by the ſame Spirit as they were. I asked why they did abuſe their Power then, and make uſe of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weapons? He ſaid they did not, they were all ſpiritual, their Inquiſition, &amp; their Chains and Irons, and all is ſpiritual <hi>[the Wiſe may judge.]</hi> And he asked, Whether we judged them all damn'd that were not of our Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I ſaid, Nay, we had otherwiſe learned Chriſt; thoſe that were in a reprobate Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to day, the Lord may call them out of it to morrow, for what I know.

               <p>IN a Viſion of the night, I ſaw in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament ſix Suns; one at a diſtance from the reſt, that did appear to be but half an hour high; the other five ſtood four-ſquare, one in the middle; and they did croſs over each other; the higheſt did not ſeem to be above an hour high. And when I did awake, I was troubled in my ſpirit to know the Viſion; and I waited upon the Lord, and he ſignified to me in the Light, The ſix Suns were ſix Nations, whoſe Lights were near out; and the five which croſſed each other, ſignified to me ſome riſing amongſt them.</p>
               <p>And the Friar came to me, and ſaid, <hi>It was God's will we ſhould be kept there, or elſe they could not keep us. I</hi> told him, the Lord did ſuffer wicked men to do wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but did not will them to do it. He did ſuffer <hi>Herod</hi> to take off <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> head, but he did not will him to do it: and did ſuffer <hi>Stephen</hi> to be ſtoned, and <hi>Judas</hi> to betray Chriſt, but he did not will them to
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:38158:46" rendition="simple:additions"/> do it; for if he had, he would not have condemned them for it. He ſaid, <hi>Then we are wicked men.</hi> I ſaid, They are wicked men that work wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>The Friar would ſay ſtill, <hi>We had not the true Faith.</hi> We ſaid, By Faith we ſtand, and by the Power of God we are upholden; doſt thou think it is by our own power and holineſs we are kept from a vain conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, from ſin and wickedneſs? He ſaid, <hi>That was our pride.</hi> We ſaid, No, We could glory in the Lord, we were children of wrath once as well as others; but the Lord hath quickned us that were dead, by the living Word of his Grace, and hath waſhed, cleanſed and ſanctified us through ſoul and ſpirit, in part, according to our meaſures, and we do preſs forward towards that which is perfect. <hi>He</hi> then ſaid, <hi>We were good Women, but yet there was no redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption for us, except we would be Cathlicks.</hi>

               <p>The Room wherein I was ſeparated, was near the <hi>Chancery,</hi> where all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops Courtiers did reſort, and would come into the Inquiſition Courts, and I had work amongſt them daily; they would come on purpoſe to their condemnation: ſome would be ſmitten, and run as if they hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and ſome would be ſet on fire, and cry, <hi>Caldere, caldere,</hi> and <hi>fuoco, fuoco;</hi> and many would pitty us, becauſe we were not Catholicks: the Friars would ſay, <hi>We might be Catholicks, and keep our own Religion too: and we ſhould not be known we were Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, except we were brought before a Juſtice of Peace.</hi> We askt if we ſhould profeſs a Chriſt we ſhould be aſham'd of?</p>

               <p>What they would have done to <hi>Sarah</hi> if they had taken her forth, we know not; but the Lord did work ſo wonderfully that night for the preſervation of her poor ſoul out of their net, that he is worthy to be glorified for ever.</p>

               <p>And we were parted One Year, but great was the Work of the Lord, and great was the Power to carry it on. He was not wanting to us, glory be to his Name, but did give us Words &amp; Wiſdom according to our Work: So that Scripture was fulfilled which ſaith on this vviſe, <hi>Ye need not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditate afore-hand what to ſpeak, or what
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:38158:49"/> to ſay; for it ſhall be given you of my hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father what ye ought to ſpeak,</hi> that the Enemies ſhall not gain-ſay: they were ſo tormented, that they did run to the Hills and to the Mountains, to cover them from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Wrath of the Lamb, which ſits upon the Throne, to judge them righteouſly, and to condemn them for all their wicked deeds, which they ſo ungodlily had committed againſt him.</p>
               <p>Oh! the goodneſs of the Lord, and his long-ſuffering and forbearance, vvhich would lead them to Repentance; but they would not hearken to his Counſel, but turned his Laws behind their backs, and hated to be inſtructed by them; therefore the Lord did laugh at their deſtruction, and did mock when their fear came: Their wickedneſs was ſo great, and my burthen ſo heavy to bear it, that I cryed to the Lord, and ſaid, It is better for me to die, than to live: and would gladly have given up my life in teſtimony againſt them all; I was (as 'twere) compelled to declare againſt all their Wayes, Works and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, inſomuch that they ran to the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor to have me chained, or puniſh'd ſome other way; but the Power of the Lord
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:38158:49"/> chained them, that they could not diminiſh a hair of my head; the Lord was my ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, praiſes be to his Name for ever.</p>
               <p>Now ſome, as they paſſed to their Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip-houſes, would ſigh, and ſome pray, and ſome did throw ſtones at my Window; they did work night and day about the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as though they would have broke through to ſlay me; but the Lord was with me, and did fight for me, and did ſcatter his Enemies as the duſt before the Wind: Glory be to his Name for evermore.</p>
               <p>I cannot expreſs the large Love of our God, how he did preſerve us from ſo many Deaths and Threatnings, as they did come to me with, falling down upon their knees, ſaying Maſs, and would have me to ſay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; but in the Name of the Lord I denyed them. They would howl like Dogs, becauſe they could not beguile the Innocent, and ſlay my righteous life; but praiſes be to the Lord our God, who did preſerve me from the Wolf and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers, denying them &amp; their Sacrifices.</p>
               <p>And when they ſaw they could not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail to betray us from the Truth, then they ſaid, <hi>they would give us to the Devil to be tormented, and deliver us over to their bad Catholicks, to do by us as they pleaſed;</hi> for
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:38158:50"/> they would uſe us badly, and ſo they did ſeek to do: Oh the curſed noiſes and cryes the <hi>Sodomites</hi> did make, crying, <hi>Quake, quake,</hi> running about the Priſon raging, and ſome ſinging, and crouding round the Priſon night and day, as if they would have broke through to ſlay me; and the ſons of <hi>Belial</hi> did run to bear falſe witneſs, ſo that I looked every hour when they would fetch me out, and ſlay me. The Enemy did ſo work to perſwade, that they had preſt my dear yoke fellow with ſtones, which was a great trouble to me, becauſe I I could not ſuffer death with her; I did yeeld ſhe had been ſlain. And afrerwards this great tribulation being ended, then they ſaid, my (dear and faithful) yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſhould be ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and I ſhould tarry at <hi>Malta;</hi> which did ſo encreaſe my ſorrow and wrought upon my ſpirit, to try and examine wherefore the Lord ſhould deal ſo hardly with me, as to leave me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; or whether he did not count me worthy to go and give in my Teſtimony with her, to <hi>Rome,</hi> and offer up my Life for the Teſtimony of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> than to have my liberty to return to <hi>England</hi> with her? and I cryed day and night to the Lord, and would not give my ſoul reſt, nor my eyes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:38158:50" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſleep, till the Lord did anſwer me, glory and praiſes be to his Name for ever. But we ſaw <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt part with all, <hi>Benjamin</hi> muſt go too. So we were willing to give up in obedience to the Lord; our tryals were unſpeakable. Oh the unclean ſpirits! they would ſpeak to us at noon-day; but the Lord did give us power over them, that we did not fear the wild Boars out of the Wood, nor the wild Beaſts out of the Field.</p>
               <p>Then there was one came and ſaid, that <hi>Katherine and I muſt be both ſent to Rome.</hi> Which did rejoyce my ſoul, and renewed my ſtrength, becauſe the Lord did count me worthy to go and give in my Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny for his Truth, the Word of his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, before the great and mighty ones of the Earth. The Lord ſaid, <hi>I ſhould not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid;</hi> and he ſhewed me in the Light how he had bowed them down before us, and I ſaw them in the Light of Chriſt, how the <hi>Pope,</hi> the <hi>Friars</hi> and <hi>Sorcerers</hi> ſtood in ranks, bowing down before us. So we ſaw our Dominion in Spirit. They did work to ſend us to <hi>Rome,</hi> but the Lord did blaſt it, and fought againſt them, that they could not ſend us.</p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:38158:51"/>
               <p>Now our Teſtimony was as largely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in at <hi>Rome,</hi> as at <hi>Malta.</hi> The Friars came to me, and ſhewed me <hi>Mary</hi> and her Babe pictured againſt a Wall, and would have me look upon it. I ſtampt with my foot, and ſaid, Curſed be all Images and Image-makers, and all that fall down to worſhip them; Chriſt Jeſus is the expreſs Image of his Fathers Brightneſs, which is Light and Life; who doth reveal the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity, the cunning working of Satan, to draw out the mind to follow him, from the pure Life, and to vail over the Juſt One from beholding the Preſence of the Lord. But glory be to the Lord, who hath made him manifeſt in thouſands of his, in this Day of his Power. When we were ſeparated, we ſpake one and the ſame thing, being guided by one Spirit. They would go from me to <hi>Katherine,</hi> and they would bid her <hi>ſpeak as Sarah did,</hi> and ſo ſhe did, to their condemnation: Praiſes to the Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>

He ſaid, <hi>He would not that we ſhould write; for St.</hi> Paul <hi>did work at</hi> Rome, <hi>and we might get nine or ten grains a day, if we did knit, that is three half-pence.</hi> I told him, if we could have that priviledge amongſt them, that <hi>Paul</hi> had at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which was a Heatheniſh King, we would have wrought, and not have been chargeable to any. <hi>Paul</hi> lived in his own hired houſe two years, with a Souldier to look to him, and had Friends of the ſame Occupation to work with him, and could ſend where he would, and whoſoever would come to him, might, and he taught them in the Name of the Lord Jeſus; and no man forbad him. So I askt him, Whether he knew the holy War of God, yea or nay? if he did, I told him he then did know we could not be without exerciſe day nor night. Then his mouth was ſtopped, and he ſpake no more to me of work. But though our affliction of body

But we could not work at the Friar's will, nor any mans elſe, but as we had freedom in the Lord.</p>
               <p>As I was weak in my bed, the Friar came to me, and ſaid, <hi>We did deny the Scriptures.</hi> I told him, they did deny them; we did own them, and hold them forth, thou doſt know it. He was in a rage, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſaid they denied the Scriptures, and bid me <hi>eat my words again, and threatned death upon me.</hi> I ſaid, Chriſt Jeſus was the Light of the World, and had lighted every one that cometh into the World; which Light is our Salvation that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, and the ſame Light is the Worlds Condemnation that do not believe in it. Then he ſaid, <hi>He would lay me in Chains, where I ſhould neither ſee Sun nor Moon.</hi> They ſay, <hi>The</hi> Father <hi>hath almoſt killed you,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>but I will kill you quite before I have done.</hi> He had a Book in his hand, and he did ſtudy in it: I told him, he did
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:38158:54"/> comprehend the words in his carnal mind; and he was wroth, and ſaid, <hi>he would give me to the Devils to be tormented.</hi> I ſaid, I deny the Devil and all his works and workers.</p>
               <p>Some would come unto the Priſon upon their Saints dayes, and ask us, <hi>what day it was?</hi> We did anſwer, We did not know, neither did we obſerve dayes nor times, months nor years.

We further ſaid, <hi>Paul</hi> did call it <hi>beggarly Elements</hi> and <hi>Rudiments of the World,</hi> to obſerve days, times, months and years; and their mouthes would be ſtopt for a time. Then came the Friar ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, and told me, <hi>it was ſeventeen dayes to their Chriſtmas;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Mary conceived with child that day,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame day he ſpake to me on; as if ſhe did go with child but ſeventeen dayes.

               <p>MY dearly beloved Siſters &amp; Friends of Truth, I dearly ſalute you in the Light, Life and Love of our God, which is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the holy Ghoſt, wherein I do rejoyce, and have union with you. My Life is given up to ſerve the Lord. Oh how my ſoul travels for the Seed of God's Kingdom, to be ſown throughout all Nations, for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering in of Chriſt's ſcattered Flock, and for the deſtruction of ſin and Satan: For our God is weighing the Mountains in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:38158:70"/> Scales, and the Duſt in an equal Ballance: He is pulling down the mighty, and raiſing the meek, humble, lowly; he is feeding the poor and hungry with good things, but the rich he ſends empty away. My dear Babes and Lambs, feed of the ſincere Milk of the Word of Life, that you may grow up in it, and wax ſtrong in ſpirit to praiſe the Lord, and to glorifie him who is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. Be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; ſeek him earneſtly, call upon him continually; let your whole Meditations be ſtaid in him alway. Seek him earneſtly; deny your own thoughts and words; give heed to the Light, bring all your deeds to it; give up all that is contrary, to be ſlain; ſtand ſingle, empty, naked before the Lord, that you may be filled with the Streams of his everlaſting Love. Oh my dear hearts! our God is full of love; ſtand not back, preſs forward, let nothing hinder you; the Lord calls for you, <hi>My Son, give me thy heart:</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of our God is as large to you as to any, if you can believe; your ſtraitneſs is in your ſelves; For God is a full Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; abundance of love runs forth to them that can truſt him; I can witneſs it; in the barren Wilderneſs he cauſed ſtreams
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:38158:71"/> of living Water to break forth: I cannot expreſs it, it is ſo large; therefore doth my ſoul thirſt after you, my dear Ones; the love of God is to you. My dear Siſters, I have you in my remembrance, and do pray to my God and your God, that you may be enlarged in your meaſures to praiſe the Lord, and to be kept in a ſenſible feeling of his Power daily; and that you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in wiſdom, ſtrength and power over God's Enemies. The Bleſſing of the Lord God Almighty be with you, and preſerve you by his mighty Power, unto the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>Oh our dearly beloved Friends, did you know but the third part of the Afflictions the Lord our God hath carried us through, you would ſay, The Lord hath wrought as great a Miracle in our preſervation, as ever he did in raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:38158:79"/> Grave: And in the greateſt of our afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we could not ſay in our hearts, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, would thou hadſt not brought us hither, but cryed mightily to our God for Power to carry us through whatſoever ſhould be inflicted upon us, that the Truth of our God might not ſuffer through our weakneſs: And the Lord did hear us, and anſwered us in righteouſneſs, and carried us on with all boldneſs, and made our fore-heads as Flint, &amp; our brows as Braſs, in the faces of our Enemies, that whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we were brought forth upon tryal, all fear was taken away, that we ſtood as Iron-Gates, and Caſtle-Walls in the faces of our Enemies, ſo that they ſaid, <hi>we would fain be burned;</hi> but we anſwered, No, we would not willingly be burned; but if our heavenly Father doth call us to ſuffer in that kind for his Name ſake, he will give us power to go through it: and we have great cauſe to believe it; for our Lord God never called us to do any ſervice for him, but he gave us power, and made way for his own Work; glory and praiſe be to his holy Name for ever.</p>
               <p>Dearly beloved Friends, marvel not why <hi>Iſrael</hi> is not gathered in all this time; it is not for want of labour, nor travel, nor
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:38158:79"/> grief, nor pain, faſting nor mourning, nor weeping, nor love to their ſouls; but it is becauſe of the great Oppreſſion: For here are a willing people, but they dare not until the Lord make way for them. Truly Friends, we have not been idle ſince we ſaw your faces, nor have we had much eaſe to the fleſh, but do travel night and day for <hi>Sion's</hi> proſperity and perfect joy, and for the reparation of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and her pure praiſe; though our ſorrows are deep, and our afflictions grievous, yet we do wait with patience to reap the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fruits of righteouſneſs, and enjoy the benefit of our uprightneſs; Praiſes be to our God for ever, he hath kept us by his power and holineſs, that our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies have not one jot or tittle againſt us, but for the Truth of our God, and that we could not joyn with them; ſo they would not ſuffer us to have one line of refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſtript us out of all, ſo that we could not expect one drop of mercy, favour nor affection, but what our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did diſtil upon us from his living pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and work for us by the operation of his own Arm of ſtrength and power.</p>
               <p>But dear Friends, though a long Winter, and many ſharp and terrible Storms have
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:38158:80"/> paſt over our heads, ſo that we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs our Sorrows; ſo likewiſe we cannot declare our Joys. Oh! in the midſt of all our afflictions, our God did draw nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and did ſpeak comfortably unto us with many ſweet and precious Promiſes, and did never ſuffer his faithfulneſs to fail us, nor was he wanting unto us in Viſions and Revelations. Oh! how doth he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in his Glory, Beauty and Brightneſs, ſo that our ſouls are raviſhed and wrapped up with his living preſence and glory ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times, ſo that we do not dare to look out at our long-ſufferings nor tryals, but do preſs forwards towards the fulneſs of Joy and Bleſſedneſs, which our eternal Father hath prepared for all them that love him, and walk in obedience to him; and we know, the deeper our ſorrow is, the greater our Joy ſhall be; and the heavier our Croſs, the weightier our Crown, as we abide faithful: And we do believe, that neither principalities, nor powers, nor ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, nor impriſonment, nor perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor life nor death, ſhall be able to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us from the Love of God in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord and Saviour, <hi>Amen:</hi>

And we do behold your order and ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your Faith, and Labour of love, and are daily refreſhed in all the faithful-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Oh dear hearts! the remembrance of the leaſt of you is precious. Oh! the Rivers of tears that have diſtilled from our eyes, whilſt we do think upon you, for joy, becauſe of your growth and flouriſhing in the Truth. Oh! you are Virgins indeed, who have Oyl in your Veſſels, and your Lamps burning, and are clothed with the long white Robes of Righteouſneſs, and are adorned with the Ornaments of pure beauty and glorious brightneſs (abundance of you) to our joy and comfort; and we do pray night and day, That every Babe of our Heavenly Father's begetting may proſper, even as we deſire our own ſouls ſhould proſper; and that every one may be kept out of incumbrances, and uſe the World as if they uſed it not; but every one's mind, ſpirit, heart and ſoul, may be exerciſed in the Eternal, by the Power of God, out of the earthly, and out of the viſible, out of the carnal and periſhing things of this life (ſo as to truſt in it) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heavenly, into the ſpiritual, into the

Oh, that every one may be emptied of your ſelves, and unbottomed of your ſelves, that you may build wholly upon the ſure foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and anchored ſo faſt upon the Rock of Ages, that neither the ſwelling Seas, nor the foaming Waves, nor ſtormy Winds, though they beat vehemently, may ever be able to remove you. Oh dear Brethren, in the life and power you may feel the iſſues of Love and Life, which ſtream as a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to every ſoul of you, from the hearts of us that are wholly joyned to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; Glory and everlaſting Praiſes be given to his holy Name. Our whole ſouls, ſpirits, hearts and minds, are given up to ſerve the Lord in whatſoever he requireth of us, as he ſhall make it manifeſt unto us: And we do bleſſe his Name for ever, that he hath found us worthy of ſo high a calling, as to bind Kings in chains, and Nobles in fetters of Iron. Our prayers are continually for the advancement of the Goſpel of the Lord Jeſus throughout
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:38158:81" rendition="simple:additions"/> the whole Earth, for the gathering of the Seed of the Elect of God, and for the rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of it up over the Seed of the Serpent, in power and great glory, to bear rule, and to have dominion over the whole World, that the Kingdoms of this World, may become the Kingdoms of our Lord Jeſus, that he may rule in his Princely Power, and reign in his Kingly Majeſty, whoſe Right it is; that the knowledge of the Lord may cover the Earth, as the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter covereth the Sea; that all the Children of the Lord may be taught of the Lord, and be eſtabliſhed in Righteouſneſs; that ſo the Mourners in <hi>Sion</hi> may rejoyce, and the heavy-hearted in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> may be right glad: The Lord God of Power haſten it for his own Name's ſake, and for his Elects ſake, that lye in captivity under the hands of the dark powers of the Earth, either ſpiritual or temporal; <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> ſaith our ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Dear and precious Friends and Brethren, pray for us, that we may finiſh our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to the glory of God, and to the praiſe of his holy Name, and to the comfort of all that love his appearing, and to our own eternal ſalvation, and to the ſhame and confuſion of all that hate the Lord Jeſus,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:38158:82"/> and perſecute his Truth. So in the pure Unity of the Covenant of Light, Life, Peace, Love, and everlaſting Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do we take our leaves of you all at this time, hoping and believing we ſhall ſee your faces once again, before we go hence, and be no more ſeen. Dear Friends, pray for us.</p>
               <p>Though we were in many ſtraits and hardſhips by reaſon of the oppreſſion; yet whilſt our minds were ſtaid upon the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, we ſaw no want; but our tender Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe heavenly eye was ever over us, ſaw our neceſſities, ſent his right dear and precious Servant, and juſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Steward, <hi>Daniel Baker,</hi> to adminiſter to our Neceſſities both ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; he came not in his own time, will nor ſtrength, but in the Will and Time, Strength and Power of the Almighty God; at whoſe preſence the Mountains were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the tall Cedars were made to bow, the ſtrong Oaks to ſtoop. Oh wonderful! He went to the Lord Inquiſitor (the Popes Deputy) to demand our lawful Liberty, which would not be granted, unleſs he and we would write to <hi>Meſſaena,</hi> or <hi>Legorn,</hi> to ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant, to be engaged for four thouſand Dollers: Which Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:38158:82"/> being out of the Covenant of Light, we durſt not ſtoop to it; but our dear Brother in Chriſt Jeſus offered his body for our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but it would not be granted; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing would ſerve but one to engage for four thouſand Dollers to be paid, if ever we come into theſe parts again. Then in obedience to the Lord he offered up his Life for our Freedom, but all would not ſerve; the Will of our God be done.</p>
               <p>Oh dear Friends! greater Love was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of, than for a man to lay down his Life for his Friend: Oh! it is worthy to be recorded in remembrance of him for ever; here he came up and down to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to us with his Life in his hand, time after time. So the Lord God of Power reward him double into his boſome for ever. Oh! how did he refreſh our ſouls, ſpirits, minds and bodies through great tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, which is never to be forgotten.</p>

               <head>A ſhort Relation of ſome more of their exceeding great Tryals and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</head>
               <p>NOw in ſhort time after we were taken Priſoners, we were ſtung with Flyes called <hi>Muskatoes,</hi> in our faces &amp; our heads, as we lay in our Beds, that were ſwollen as if we had the ſmall-Pox, ſo that all people were afraid of us, ſave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul; they thought we had been unclean perſons, ſo that a Friar told <hi>Sarah</hi> he ſaw an evil Spirit in her face, which was a great tryal; they could not ſleep in their beds in the houſe, they were ſo tormented; and we were told, that they had ſeen them that did pray and preach every day, were burnt for Witches in a ſhort time; and they would keep us to ſee our lives &amp; conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations; and ſo they have: And glory be to our God, they cannot lay guilt to our charge, but are made to confeſs the Truth.</p>
               <p>In a few dayes after we were there, in a Viſion in the night, the Lord appeared to me, and ſhewed me, that round about us,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:38158:83"/> and above and beneath us, there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Magicians of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> and the Lord ſmote me, and ſaid unto me, <hi>The Devil hath deſired to winnow you as Wheat; but pray that your Faith fail not.</hi> And the ſight was very dreadful and terrible; and the Voice of the Lord did awake me with much trembling and amazement, and a great War, for the ſpace of twelve hours, before I could get the victory; and we did witneſs but little eaſe to the fleſh night nor day. We went in obedience to the Lord to one of their Tower-Houſes, in time of their Worſhip, and ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in the midſt of them; and I was made to turn my back to the high Altar, and kneel down, and lift up my voice in prayer unto the Lord; and he that was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Service, drew off his Surplice, and kneeled a little beſide us till I had done, and he reacht forth his hand to us, to come to him, and offered me a token; and the Lord ſhewed me it was the Mark of the Beaſt; and I refuſed it; and he put it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Sarah</hi>'s hand, and ſhe gave it him again, and ſhewed him her Purſe, that ſhe had to give, if any had need. And he asked if we were <hi>Calviniſts</hi> or <hi>Lutherans?</hi> And we ſaid, Nay: And he asked if we would go
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:38158:84" rendition="simple:additions"/> to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope? But we denied. And he asked if we were <hi>Catholicks?</hi> And we told him, We were true Chirſtians, the Servants of the living God. And many of them were amazed, and came round about us; we having but little of their Tongue, gave our Teſtimony (for the Lord) in words and ſigns, as well as we could; and they were made ſubject to the Power at that preſent, praiſes be given to our God, and we departed in peace.</p>
               <p>And ſince that, the Lord laid ſuch a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy burthen upon us, that we did queſtion what he would do with us, before we knew the mind of God in it. And upon a ſet-day they had a great Meeting to take their holy Sacrament (as they call it) in a high place; but we knew nothing of it, nor where it was, but what the Lord revealed to us: And we were made to go in, and ſtand in the midſt; and there were many lights in divers places, &amp; many Chriſts, as they call them, and much coſtlineſs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations of the Earth; they had ſo many ſorts of holy Garments (as they call them) of ſo many colours, that it would make one wonder how the Devil did invent it. And there we were made to ſtand in the midſt for the ſpace of three parts of an
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:38158:84"/> hour, as near as I can judge, in great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, trembling and quaking, and bitter mourning, ſo that they were all amazed, and ſome removed further for fear, but knew not what to do; for I never did wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſuch an Earthquake. In the end one came ſoberly, and ſpake to us to go forth; and we went in the Lord's time, and ſate at the door trembling and mourning, to the aſtoniſhment of them; and being ſo overcome with their Abominations, we went along the ſtreet reeling to and fro, and ſtaggering like drunken men, ſo that we were a wound to all that ſaw us: It was the wonderful Power of God that made way for us to go forth to them, and kept us. They have uſed all the Craft they have day and night, to inchant us, as the Lord hath made it known unto us; Glory and praiſes be to his everlaſting Name for evermore. We know that there is no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment againſt <hi>Jacob,</hi> nor divination againſt <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Dearly beloved Friends, We dearly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute you all in the inviſible Life of our God, who is our life, our peace, our ſtay and ſtrength; under whoſe Shadow we are refreſhed; praiſes, glory and honor be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:38158:85"/> unto his powerful Name, of all his, for ever.</p>
               <p>Truly Friends, we are not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the large Mercies of our God, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed unto us from time to time; his Horn is our Strength, and his Name our ſtrong Tower in all our troubles, temptations, tryals and ſufferings; he is a God at hand, and not afar off, and doth make us ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before-hand, by Viſions and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what is coming upon us; and doth arm us with his own Armour, and makes us as bold as Lyons; for we fear not the face of man, becauſe we know we ſhall not ſuffer any thing but what ſhall make for the glory of our God: But truly we had fainted long ago, had not the Lord upheld us by his free Spirit; but we know the Lord taketh care of the leaſt of them that truſt him; Praiſes be unto him for ever. Dear Friends, though we be abſent in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet we are preſent in ſpirit, and do feel you in that which cannot be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as we abide faithful, and are much refreſhed in you; and the remembrance of you is precious unto us: Oh, that all our Friends could prize the company and the ſight of each others faces. We do not want the company of Friars, Jeſuites and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:38158:85" rendition="simple:additions"/> nor great women. Here are ſome that have breathings after Life, but they dare not ſhew it; for the ſame thing that was, is; they will not enter in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor ſuffer them that would.</p>
               <p>The Lord Inquiſitor ſent to us, That if we would (being we are good women) we ſhould go into the Nunnery amongſt the holy women, and be maintained as long as we live, in regard we have denied the world, and all that we have. And the Friar told us, if we would come to their Maſſe-houſe, and receive their holy Sacrament, we ſhould be the moſt eminent Catholicks in all <hi>Malta.</hi> But we denied them in the Name of the Lord, and all their dead fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery which they have invented. Here we are kept under the Inquiſition, as they ſay, till they have Orders from the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> what they ſhould do with us.</p>
               <p>We beſeech you all, faithful Friends, pray for us, for great are our tryals: Did you but know the Abominations that the Devil hath invented here, you would think it were tryal enough. But here we have cruel mockings; and the ſame contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, tryals and temptations that ever the Servants of the Lord had, and Chriſt himſelf. It is the wonderful Power of
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:38158:86"/> God that we are preſerved till this time; for all the whole Iſland are Papiſts, and given up to Idolatry. We are deſpiſed of all People, and abhorred of all Nations; and becauſe they cannot have any juſt thing againſt us, they do invent lies againſt us: but the Lord is on our ſide, for elſe the Enemy would ſoon deſtroy us; for great is their rage; and we have continual war with them, night and day we feel: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold their threatnings and cruelty is more than our tongues can expreſs. Great is the love of our God, for he doth refreſh us with the ſweet drops of his mercy, and doth water us every moment with the everlaſting ſprings of his Love, or elſe we had fainted long ago.</p>
               <p>Oh! let all who know the Lord, praiſe and glorifie his holy Name for ever and ever, <hi>Amen.</hi> Dear Friends, farewel in the Lord.</p>

               <p>Oh my dear, precious and endeared one! thou meek Lamb, thou innocent Dove, who doſt bear the likeneſs, beauty and brightneſs of that unſpotted One that is come in the Volumn of the Book to do the Will of God: We can give in our Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony for thee, that thou cameſt here in the Power &amp; Authority of the Moſt High, to which the tall Cedars were made to bow, and the ſtrong Oaks to bend; praiſes, praiſes be given to our everlaſting God for evermore.</p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:38158:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Oh my dearly beloved Brother, thy beauty ſhineth indeed, thou art all glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous within and without; thy Garments are perfumed with all delightſom ſcents; We ſmell the ſweet Odours thereof, and do feel the fulneſs of Love and Life which runs from thy tender heart day and night to us, and in the ſame Unity of <hi>Love</hi> do our hearts ſtream forth to thee, as thou knoweſt full well: Oh how have our hearts and bowels been melted for thee! our heads and eyes have run with tears, and our ſouls have been poured forth to our heavenly Father for thy preſervation, and we did truly labour to ſee thy face before thou cameſt: Glory and praiſes be given to our Eternal <hi>Lord God, Amen,</hi> ſaith our ſpirits; that he doth vouchſafe us ſo great a mercy, as to behold the face of ſo preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Friend. We do beſeech God to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate us with his Eternal Spirit, that we may alwayes be mindful of his mercies, and never to let his benefits ſlip out of our minds. We have been near death many times, when we had none to come near us, but thoſe that preached death and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to us; I have lain twelve dayes, or more, in a faſt, in ſtrong travel night and day, that my dearly beloved Yoke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:38158:87" rendition="simple:additions"/> would have been glad if the Lord would have taken me out of the body, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of my great affliction.</p>
               <p>Then the Engliſh Friar which was here, came up and down to us, and would ſay to my Friend, <hi>She is ready to depart; ſend for me, and take notice what tormentt ſhe will be in; a thouſand Devils will be about her, to fetch her ſoul to Hell, becauſe ſhe will not be a Catholick.</hi> And after we were parted, we were called to faſt, ſo that my Friend was ſo weak, that ſhe put on ſuch linnen upon her head, as ſhe thought to lie in in her Grave: We did eat but little in a month together, when our money was almoſt done, till we did know the mind of the Lord what to do. Then thy did run to and fro like mad men, and the Friars did come and ſay, The Inquiſitor ſent them to tell us, we might have any thing we would eat; and they did ſay, it was not poſſible that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver creatures could live with ſo little meat for ſo long a time together. They did bring us meat, and ſay, the Engliſh Conſul did ſend it. It was a glorious Faſt indeed, the Lord did appear wonderfully in it, praiſes be given to him for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were very weak, becauſe the power did work ſo ſtrongly; I had no manner of food
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:38158:88"/> in my body five or ſix days together; We did lie in our clothes, becauſe we had no ſtrength to put them off, nor one to make our bed: Then we did ſpeak to the Friar, that we might come together; but he ſaid they had no ſuch order; if we would have a Phyſician, we might. And there we lay, none knowing from morning to morning whether we were dead or alive. We were kept quiet and ſtill till the Lord's time was come; they brought many things for us to eat: Then the Lord ſaid, <hi>Thou mayeſt take as freely as if thou hadſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for it with thy hands; I will ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie it to thee through the Croſs.</hi> And he ſaid unto <hi>Sarah, <hi>ſhe ſhould eat of the fruit of her hands, and be bleſſed.</hi>
                  </hi> And we did eat, and were refreſhed, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Lord; We did cry mightily unto the Lord night and day, that we might not eat nor drink to offend him, we would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dye. The Lord was well pleaſed with our Sacrifice, and did increaſe our ſtrength, and adminiſtred comfort to us; honor and glory be to his bleſſed Name for ever. In the loweſt of all our conditions, we were kept a top of all the mountains, ſo that they could not make us ſhrink or bow one jot or tittle to any of their Precepts or
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:38158:88"/> Commands. Yet the Friars have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us in the name of their god to kneel with them in prayer.</p>
               <p>The time is too little for me to diſcloſe the twentieth part of the terrible tryals; but whenſoever we were brought upon any tryal, the Lord did take away all fear from us, and multiplied our ſtrength, and gave us power and boldneſs to plead for the Truth of the Lord Jeſus, and wiſdom of words, to ſtop the mouthes of the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers, that they would be made to ſay, We ſpake Truth; they could never ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: But they would ſay, <hi>We had not the true Faith, but we had all Virtues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Oh dear heart! if it be our Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good pleaſure to carry thee away without us, we do beſeech our heavenly Father to bleſs, and give thee a proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous return, and to feed thee with the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the powerful Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Amen.</hi> And we do believe we ſhall not want thy pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, nor the prayers of all the Faithful, that we may keep faithful to the end; ſo that our God may be glorified, his Church and People may be refreſhed and rejoyced, and we may receive our Reward with the reſt of the Lord's Lambs.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:38158:89"/>
               <p>Our Life is with the; for oh! thou art full of Love, thou tender-hearted one, who haſt offered up thy ſanctified body, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified life, in obedience to the Lord, for us poor afflicted Lambs with thee, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions in tribulations, trials and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in perils at Sea, and perils by Land. Oh thou precious Lamb of God, great is thy reward in Heaven, great will be the Well-ſpring of joy that will ariſe in thee, in thy Journey: Oh thou happy one indeed! whom the Lord our God hath made choice of amongſt his faithful Flock, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with ſo much power to come into ſuch a place as this, not the like in all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> by their own report, and all others, and to ſtop the mouths of Lyons, and to trample upon the heads of Serpents, Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions and Vipers of the Earth, and they could not hurt thee; their ſtings are taken out of their heads, and out of their tails; Glory, Honour and everlaſting Praiſes be given to our God for evermore, of all that know him, for he is worthy.</p>
               <p>And the Lord bleſs thee and thine for ever <hi>Amen,</hi> and encreaſe thy ſtrength, and multiply thee abundantly in every good Gift and Grace, and proſper all thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:38158:89"/> that thou mayeſt be approved for ever before the King of Saints, in the General Aſſembly of the Moſt High, and ſtand before the Throne of his Majeſty with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory; <hi>Amen, Amen,</hi> ſaith our ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Dearly beloved pray for us, that we fall not, nor fail, whereby our Enemies may have any advantage to rejoyce, and ſay, We ſerved a God that could not ſave us, and called upon a God that could not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us; as if we were like them, to call upon ſtocks, ſtones, pictures, and painted walls, and dead things, that cannot ſee, hear nor ſpeak through their throats.

Once my way was ſtopt, and my perſecution was

               <p>This they ſpake concerning the Money I left with them, and for their neceſſities: And the Lord did appear unto me in a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the night, and ſmote me on the arm, and ſaid, <hi>Look, there is the Pope, he will not hurt thée;</hi> where he ſtood in the room as one forſaken of God and man; this was at the Engliſh Conſuls, when there was ſome fear upon me concerning him. Now here is a <hi>Roman</hi> in the Priſon which came hither upon ſome account, he is a Doctor of Law, and differs from them in many things; but they are all of one ſpirit: He doth conſtantly affirm, that the Pope hath ſent an Order to ſet us free; and he ſaith, they are liars and falſe blaſphemers, if they do ſay the Pope ſent any ſuch Order as they ſpeak of.

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:38158:92"/> they cannot agree, becauſe they do act contrary to the Will of God; the Lord ſets it all on fire, and hath burned all that they have done theſe three years concerning us.

I have lain very weak three weeks at a time. There are many for us, as far as they do dare. The Lord ſayes, there were two with the Inquiſitor for us, and did plead much with him: I did ſee it in a Night-Viſion. The Engliſh Conſul which is dead, was with us two ſeveral times after we were in the Inquiſition; he ſaid he would lend us five pounds when we did want: but when our Money was near done, we were made to rejoyce great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and could not take any of any one. We did not know the mind of the Lord in it; but had we had Money, we had not known the mighty Power of God. Now we are able to truſt the Lord where-ever he ſhall carry us without money.

But oh! how the Chriſtians (by name) in <hi>Aſia</hi> (who ſhould firſt have received the Word of ſaving-health) how did they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and reproach not only us, but our living Teſtimony and Meſſage of Bleſſedneſs, which day by day was ſounded in their ears notwithſtanding: The Lord God lay not what they did againſt us to their charge, when they have moſt need of mercy and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:38158:102"/> peace with God, if, happily, repentance unto life be witneſſed by them, who know not what they did; yea, and my Spirit is ready to ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> for their ſakes that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us without a cauſe, as the ſame unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving nature did our Lord and Maſter, whom we love, ſerve and honour in the ſame, and therefore keep his Sayings, which are not grievous to us in that one and the ſelfe-ſame Spirit, which reproves the World for ſin, in which we worſhip him as the Father; the which guideth into all Truth, from all Evil; concerning which we well admoniſhed their minds to ſubject to the One, and to avoid and turn from the other, each having their proper effects at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending them, as anguiſh, woes, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp; diſquietments upon the ſoul and conſcience that doth evil; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, bleſſings, peace, glory, honor, and the goodneſs of God attending the ſoul of man which worketh good, in the Light of the ſame excellent Spirit of God which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth the Conſcience in temperance and ſobriety, meeekneſs and gentleneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And on this wiſe we beſought the men of our own Nation, together with many more in thoſe parts, that they might become
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:38158:103"/> a ſweet ſavour of the pure Life of Chriſt and Chriſtianity indeed and in truth, which tends to anſwer the Witneſs of the Eternal God, manifeſt in <hi>Turks, Greeks, Jews, Heathens,</hi> and Apoſtate Chriſtians, among the dark Nations, where they have their converſation: Yet I am conſtrained to expreſs ſomewhat of their manner of dealing with us to our good; Wherefore Men of reaſonable and honourable under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, may bear with me, to the end that the honeſt-hearted may be informed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of a perſecuting Spirit, which is not of God, neither ever was it born of him.</p>
               <p>Their Threatnings encreaſed daily, and they burdened themſelves exceedingly with us, whoſe Deportment and Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our they were made to confeſs to; as did the Conſul and divers others; which in truth they could not ſay otherwiſe, but that it was temperate, innocent, harmleſs and unblameable in our Converſation; Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified be the Lord, and bleſſed be his Grace of Life, by which we in ſubmiſſion to the ſame, were guided herein: But becauſe our Teſtimony was not for, but againſt whatſoever might be ſaid in truth to be evil, unjuſt, or unequitable <hi>(which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable)</hi> therefore were we hated of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:38158:103"/> High and Lofty, to the diſquieting of their own reſt day and night; becauſe they bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened themſelves ſo with the truth and innocency of the Lord's Teſtimony, which our Life held forth among them who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the ſame in his love, that they might be ſaved not only from ſin, but alſo from the wrath to come. So they forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſent a Meſſage from <hi>Smyrna,</hi> to the great City <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> to the King's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of <hi>England,</hi> and beſought him to expel us out from among them of <hi>Aſia,</hi> that we might not have a Being in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their Authority, in viſiting them on this wiſe, as by the annexed Warrant thou that reads the ſame, may underſtand.</p>

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:38158:105"/> Ceremonies, which are below men of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yet he deſired that we might not take it ill as from him (in his place of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority) in doing as he was obliged in the proſecution of the Warrant, which ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned all Officers and Members of the Factory, with Maſters &amp; Officers of Ships, to be aiding and aſſiſting to ſurprize and baniſh two innocent, naked, harmleſs Men, that had neither Bow nor Sword, nor any ſuch like material or viſible Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon of War to reſiſt evil, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabus</hi> had not, againſt whom the hard-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Jews</hi> cryed out with the ſame voice, <hi>Help men of Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. and ſuch like ſtir there was. And we let the Conſul know at our firſt coming, that we owned his place of Authority, and were ready to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to any thing that was juſt or equitable; and at laſt, in this thing, we could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit without ſuffering, foraſmuch as in the uprightneſs of our heart, and in the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the ſame, were we come ſo far to do the Will of God, and to ſuffer for it, as his hand permitted.</p>
               <p>So with many other expreſſions I clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my Conſcience, as alſo by Words, Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and Writings, to the whole Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there; and the Conſul ſeemed to be
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:38158:105" rendition="simple:additions"/> unwilling to uſe violence againſt us, that at our departure we prayed for them that hated us without a cauſe, knowing not what they did; we ſeeing it could not at that ſeaſon be otherwiſe, but what the Lord had permitted them to bring to paſs, not to their juſtification, but as a Judgement among them from the living God, who did not onely diſpence the viſitation of his Love and Salvation day by day among them, but he viſited them alſo with the ſtrokes of his Diſpleaſure, even unto death and deſtruction; and ſurely he ſmote and took away of the Chiefeſt, &amp; others of them daily: And verily my heart often cryed, and beſought the Lord for them in ſecret more eſpecially, (though I was conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to ceaſe uttering my voice openly among them, and for them) while they ſought my hurt; as many of them, I know, by the Witneſs of God in them may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member. And ſo we were ſent away as Priſoners, or rather as Lambs driven from the Dens of Lyons, or from the barren Caves of ravening Wolves, whoſe nature worried them.</p>
               <p>Now we had ſpoken for a paſſage by a <hi>Dutch</hi> ſhip, to have gone from thence to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but before the Ship depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:38158:106"/> 
                  <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Warrant came to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul's hands, which thou mayeſt ſee came not from either them called <hi>Turks, Jews, Heathens, Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Barbarians,</hi> but even from the men of our own Nation. Alas! alas! yea, wo and alas for them.</p>
               <p>So the Reader may ſee what a ſtir there hath been in the Region of <hi>Aſia,</hi> againſt the appearance of Truth, and its Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, in plainneſs, to expel and baniſh it, together with its Meſſage and Meſſengers, out of their Coaſts or Borders, and not to have any entertainment, or at leaſt to come within the extent of their Authority, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever becomes of them, let them go where they will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So as in effect they ſay, We will not have this man, the Light, Truth, Temperance, Innocency, its Life and Wiſdom from above, to rule, or have its preheminence over us in our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; we will rather chuſe to live in the practice of our own evil hearts and ways: And therefore thus to their own hurt, they ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy Wayes;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Job 21.</note> 
                  <hi>and as for the Word of the Lord, we have no delight in it.</hi> Lo they have rejected the Word of the Lord, and what Wiſdom is in them? And ſuch

               <p>And ſo with conſent they joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to baniſh Truth, its Meſſage and Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers of Peace, which provoked them to jealouſie that believed not, who ſcorned us as fools, and what not elſe, not honeſtly conſidering, how that God is provoking the Nations to jealouſie and wrath with a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh People, as in the ancient dayes, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22. was propheſied. And ſuch beſought our Lord and Maſter, even Jeſus, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of their Coaſts or Borders, who loved and fed their Swine upon the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; even the <hi>Gadarens</hi> beſought him to depart; who ſaith, <hi>He that loveth Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or Mother, or what elſe, more than Me, is not worthy of Me;</hi> and Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſuch Relations, are of more honourable eſteem than many Swine.

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:38158:107"/> paſs onward, in the tender Love of our God he did the more conſtrain me; I fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſome unwillingneſs to leave him in that condition, which was not a little croſs unto me: But in the heavenly Will and Peace of our God, and joy of the Lord, out of all viſibles we parted aſunder; and it came to paſs, that he laid down his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy there in about two dayes after.</p>
               <p>There being a Ship of <hi>Venice</hi> ready, I embarqued on the ſame, and had a good Paſſage through the Gulf of <hi>Venice.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter three Weeks were finiſhed, was I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (together with the Ships company) to receive Product or Admiſſion to come into the City, as their manner is; and there I continued about eight dayes as a ſign and wonder among many, and gave ſomewhat of a ſound of the Lord's Day (in truth) among them; and from thence I travelled to <hi>Legorn,</hi> and my face was as if it were ſet towards <hi>England,</hi> I being alone, as a Mourning-Dove in a deſolate Wilderneſs: Yet it came ſo to paſs when I arrived at the ſame Port or City, that the everlaſting Love of my God did fill and overcome my heart, and mine eye right dearly affected the ſame; and verily the living Word and Commandment of my
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:38158:108"/> God ſounded in mine ear, and mine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding was quickened in the Spirit of Life from God, ſo that I was made wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and not to rebel againſt the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Voice; [And what if I teſtifie, that mine eye ſaw the Angel of his preſence?] which was expreſly for me to give up, and paſs away from thence, to viſit his long-ſuffering Seed of Innocency, ſhut up in the Inquiſition, in the Iſle of <hi>Malta,</hi> under the Popes Authority, and to communicate to their neceſſities; and verily the ſweet Promiſe of the Lord entered and poſſeſſed my heart, and my God made my way pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous; for in the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance he had often ſet theſe poor afflicted long-ſuffering Innocents before my face: Wherefore my body and mind was freely offered up as my reaſonable ſervice, to ſerve his Truth, &amp; the leaſt Member of it; and ſo to the death of the Croſs, whereto I became obedient in uprightneſs of heart, as if I ſhould never ſee the face of my Kindred or Native Country more. (a Veſſel of <hi>France</hi> being ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from thence Eaſt-ward) I embarqued thereon for the Iſle of <hi>Cicilia</hi> to <hi>Maſena,</hi> and from thence to the Iſle of <hi>Malta</hi> in a Veſſel of the ſaid Iſland; and in my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:38158:108" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Veſſel did bear in to <hi>Syracuſe,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> abode three dayes in his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Rome</hi> (after he had ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack on <hi>Malta</hi>) and at <hi>Syracuſe</hi> I abode five dayes, where I gave a ſound of the Lord's Truth and Life: And ſo we imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſailed from thence, and within twenty four hours we arrived at the Iſland of <hi>Malta;</hi> and within ſome hours after I came upon the ſaid Iſland, I had admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Pope's Lord Inquiſitor, to whom I delivered my Meſſage in the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> Tongue, on this wiſe, <hi>I am come to demand the juſt Liberty of my innocent Friends; the two Engliſh Women in Priſon in the Inquiſition:</hi> And he asked, If I were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to them as a Husband or Kinſman, and whether I came out of <hi>England</hi> on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with that Meſſage. And I anſwered, I came from <hi>Legorn</hi> for that ſame end; and he replied at laſt, They ſhould abide in Priſon till they dye, except ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants or others that were able, would engage or give obligation for the value of three or four thouſand Dollers, conditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, that they ſhould never return again into thoſe Parts.</p>
               <p>On this wiſe was his reply divers times with the Conſul and many others, together
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:38158:109"/> and aſunder; but in the Name and Fear of the Lord God I withſtood the ſame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian-like Demand and Cruelty, in the Word, Power and Travel of the Lord in his innocent ſuffering Lambs behalf; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they daily threatned me with their Cruelty and Inquiſition of darkneſs, and followed me to and fro with their Officer and Black-rod, and the Pope's Deputy would have bound me, that I ſhould nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeak good nor evil to any one while I was on the Iſland, as the Conſul ſaid, ſave to him; neither to come to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alone, except the Conſul came alſo with me, or ſome of his Family at leaſt: But their Snares, Bonds and Covenants, in the Name of my God I defied, becauſe the Spirit of Life from the Lord gave me dominion through ſufferings in ſpirit, firſt, over their unjuſt dark Impoſitions; yea, and in the ſame good Authority, in the innocency and uprightneſs of my heart, I travelled through, and over the darkneſs, over its works, and ceaſed not to publiſh the end of my coming, which they would not have known abroad, and the ſound of Truth; and its dread and fame ſtruck ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in their hearts, that both high and wiſe, great Men, together with the popiſh Prieſts

               <p>And thus it comes to paſs among the Nations, becauſe we are not of this world, as our Life and Teſtimony alſo is not for, but againſt the ſame; therefore we marvel not if the World hate us, knowing its birth which is from beneath, earthly and ſenſual, perſecuteth that which is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, heavenly and ſpiritual; and ſo the Lord hath made me as a burthenſome ſtone among them. My heart bleſſeth his Name that wonderfully preſerved me: Yet ſome of them came to ſee ſomewhat of my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency.</p>
               <p>About twenty four dayes I abode upon the ſaid Iſland, they daily continuing their Threatnings againſt me as aforeſaid, and many times attempted me to take my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to <hi>Cicillia,</hi> or to ſome parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> to produce the unreaſonable and unchriſtian-like Obligation demanded by them; but in the fear of God I, with my dear Friends,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:38158:110"/> withſtood them, and they were freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up, rather to ſuffer, than to hurt Gods Truth and People thus to gratifie them; who (as it doth appear) the Spirit of the Lord God of Truth, rules neither in Pope, nor in any of his Lords, Prieſts or Jeſuites, that exerciſe ſuch Lordſhip over the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, long-ſuffering Heritage of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting God. The time haſteneth, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it cometh to paſs, that the weight of eternal Vengeance is coming over them, which the Man of Sin, and his Sons of Perdition will not be able to bear: For the doleful Cry of the Innocent, that ſighs and groans with tears, hath long uttered its voice, which hath aſcended into the ears of the Moſt High, who is higher than the Higheſt, yet hath he reſpect unto the needy, to uphold them, yea, and to ſuch as are of an upright, contrite, lowly, and trembling heart: What if I ſhould ſay, the God of Love and Long-ſuffering dwels in ſuch? and verily their ſacrifice is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in his boſom that liveth for ever; and I am a living Witne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ſo in the endleſs mercy, bleſſing and peace of our God, we parted, and I came away with the love and peace of my God within my heart, having the anſwer and living teſtimony of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and in the wiſdom of God brought away theſe their Words and Writings, which teſtifieth ſomewhat of their Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Faithfulneſs unto the Lord, his Truth &amp; People, which I right-well know, cannot be ſhut out of the Record of Life eternal, unto which I bear Record again, that they have been, and are a ſweet ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto the Lord God of Faithfulneſs, and ſo their Reward, which attends the ſame, is not only with them, but with all the Sons and Daughters of truth and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, that are ſo travelling in their Long-ſufferings, which are but light and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary in competition to the eternal weight of Glory, which afterward is to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the ſame that ſuffered in all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, even from righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> unto this day of our God; to whom be Wiſdom, Glory, Salvation, and everlaſting Thanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And it came to paſs in the third Month of the year, 1662. alſo after my God had well preſerved me in my paſſage, and in his work and ſervice from <hi>Malta</hi> to divers places in <hi>Italy,</hi> till I came to the Straits mouth (of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea) at the place called <hi>Gibralter,</hi> it was the pleaſure of the Lord God to ſuffer the Wind and Weather to continue contrary well nigh about thirty dayes, in which ſeaſon I ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many Trials and Tribulations in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, having little or no Reſt in the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Viſion and Words of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting, which ſounded often up to my underſtanding, even as the roaring of a Lyon, which mine eye ſaw, and mine ear heard alſo [in the year —61. when I was a Priſoner for the pure Word and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God and his Truth, in <hi>Worceſter</hi> City Jayl, before I departed <hi>England</hi>] and the place was the high Mountain of <hi>Gibral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> that ſtands within the King of <hi>Spains</hi> Dominion, which was the ſubject of the Viſion; and often as I caſt mine eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſcituation of the place, the pure Life and Power of God's eternal Preſence did ariſe up in me, in the word of life, ſo that I ſaw clearly that ſome great exceeding weighty ſervice for his Name and eternal
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:38158:111"/> Truths ſake was to be done by me, which was ſo terrible and dreadful to me, when as I entred into reaſoning, ſo that I was brought down even to the jaws of death in duſt and aſhes; and as <hi>Jonah</hi> turned his back upon <hi>Nineveh,</hi> the ſame temptation attended me alſo, to my wounding, before I could give up; for I fled often from the place to eſcape with my life from among ſuch an unreaſonable and bloody generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Lord would not be intreated to let ſuch a bitter Cup paſs unfulfilled, but behold with the ſound and ſtroak of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Word, his Spirit of Life became awakened, quickned, and mightily revived in me, in his Wiſdom, over all fear of the Nations of men; and the ſame brake through the ſnares and bonds of death, and over deſtruction, and the true Seed that mourned, cried, <hi>Not my Will, but thy Will be done, on earth as it is in heaven:</hi> and ſo it was a hard thing to part with little <hi>Iſaac,</hi> which is received again in the Covenant of promiſe of Life, and that was offered up which fled ſo often (but at laſt was caught in a thicket:) When the Ships of divers Nations attempted to paſs through, but the God of heaven, whom the wind and ſea obeyeth, ſuffered them not; but
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:38158:112"/> they knew not what the matter was which was revealed within my heart, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of God was againſt them, to humble them alſo, as I told them often by words and writings to clear my Conſcience; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, they ſtrove, being perplexed in their minds, and attempted often, to wit, ſeven or eight times in about twenty one dayes, and could not paſs but about two or three Leagues; and on this wiſe it happened, it would either prove calm, and then the currant would drive them back into the Straits again ſometimes, and otherwhile Storms and Tempeſts would ſcatter them, as a figure of <hi>Pharoah</hi> and his Hoſte of Egyptian darkneſs, ſo that the Chariot-wheels mine eye ſaw ſtruck off, ſo that they drove but heavily, within and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out; and at laſt I gave out among them, that God had ſervice for me to do at that place, and my Life was given up to do his Will, if I never ſaw my Native Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, Kindred, or Fathers houſe at all any more; and therefore the pleaſure of the Lord in his mighty Power had made me willing, &amp; alſo gave me dominion through and over the Bonds and Snares of Death and Deſtruction, as it were to lay down my precious Life, that I may take it again,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:38158:112" rendition="simple:additions"/> together with the body, which through his righteous judgements he had prepared to perform the good pleaſure of his Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, for his Truth and Names ſake. Now the heavenly Voice was often ſounded within my heart on this wiſe, ſaying, <hi>O Jeruſalem, cut off thine hair,</hi> and further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more to <hi>gird ſackcloth on my loins,</hi> as to the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.29. and ſo I became o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient in the ſingleneſs and innocency of my heart, unto the God of Heaven, and of my Life, as a dreadful Sign againſt the whoriſh Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and againſt all her Heads &amp; Horns throughout the world: And I then ſignified to the Maſter of the Ship, in which I was a paſſenger, how that I did believe that God would ſoon give opportunity for the Fleet of Ships to paſs away after this ſervice of God was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and after I had uſed many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions, to the end that he might ſuffer my body on that wiſe to be caſt among the wicked idolaters, lyars and murtherers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.20.</note> which are like the troubled Sea: So the Ship-maſter let my Body be on this wiſe caſt over board from the Ship, [God having provided a <hi>Whale</hi> to ſwallow up that which fled from his preſence ſo often] and
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:38158:113"/> ſo it happened, that it was upon one of their called Holy-dayes, or Saints dayes, namely, the day called <hi>Holy-Thurſday.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So I being caſt on dry land, paſſed through their ſtreets directly, until I came into the Maſs-Houſe, or Idolaters Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, among the Idolaters, where I found the Frier or Prieſt at the High Altar, down upon his knees, in his white Surplice, ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Hoſt; (which is a <hi>Chalice,</hi> or a piece of Bread, which they called the real Subſtance of the body of Chriſt, after their unclean ſpirit of darkneſs hath mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſome words over it, which they call <hi>Conſecration</hi>) and after I had ſtood a ſeaſon viewing this Idolatry, with the indignation of the eternal God ſet up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my heart againſt the ſame, I turned my back-part upon the Prieſt, and his dead god, and dumb Idols, at the high Altar; and in the holy Commandment of Life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, my face was ſet towards the people and I beheld them a certain ſeaſon in the power of God in which I ſtood; I ſaw the multitude of ignorant People upon their knees alſo, worſhipping the dark inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Imaginations of their ſottiſh Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and blind Guides, and they know not what; and in the Lord's time (which mine
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:38158:113"/> eye had a circumſpect heed unto) I then ſpread forth mine arms, and ſtript off my Veſture, and rent the ſame from top to bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, in divers pieces, and caſt them from me with indignation; and then I took my Hat off my head, (which was the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt covering of the outſide of a man) and caſt the ſame under my feet, and ſtam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped upon theſe things, and the nakedneſs appeared with the ſack-cloath covering, to their aſtoniſhment; and then with a clear voice I ſounded Repentance three times, &amp; gave teſtimony as the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet among them, that the Life of Chriſt and his Saints was ariſen from the dead; and ſo paſſed away, ſounding the ſame words of the Lord's Meſſage, with Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, through the ſtreets, as it were flying from the Idols temple, and from Idolatry, and Idolaters, until I came to the Sea ſide, and there was I moved to kneel down and pray, and give thanks to the living Lord, who had ſo wonderfully preſerved me in doing his pleaſure and good will on earth; and he ſuffered no man to touch or do me harm.</p>
               <p>And the next day following the Lord God gave opportunity accordingly as I had let the Ship-maſter know I believed
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:38158:114"/> would come to paſs, and it was ſo, and all the Fleet did partake of the bleſſing: but how many of them rewarded me (men of my own Nation, to whom I alſo conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued a ſign, which they ſpake bitter things againſt) the Lord my God ſaw the ſame, and ſmote them with rebuke and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his diſpleaſure; who in his wiſe determinate Counſel, ordained me for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dayes &amp; nights to be tryed on this wiſe, and to fall among divers temptations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, the which as a mighty Hoſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded and beſet me on every hand, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after I had done his good will in his all-ſufficient power and ſtrength: Thus the Enemy with his ſubtilty, in a myſtery, was ſuffered to compaſs me about, to ſteal away my peace and reward with my God, in whom the ſame is hid, and then I was in a bleſſed condition, though ſometime vailed for a little ſeaſon, and then the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Countenance was hid from mine eye, and therefore was I troubled: Yet, <hi>bleſſed are ye when you fall among divers Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſaith one; and verily they were even as thorns in my fleſh, yea, as Meſſengers of Satan ſuffered to buffet me for a ſeaſon; even as the Servant of God witneſſed, who was wrapt up into the third Heaven: What
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:38158:114"/> if I ſhould ſomewhat teſtifie ſo was it with me, leſt I ſhould be exalted above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſo that I was made to bow and fall upon my face, and cry day and night to the Lord of Eternal Life, that had reſpect to the tears of the Innocent, and bowed the ſtrength of his Arm to ſupport the Lowly: And ſo his Almightineſs gave ear to the ſighs and groans of my diſtreſſed ſtate, and had reſpect unto the voice of my mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as a Dove or Pelican in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and verily his Grace I found ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſave and preſerve my Innocency, in its ſweet life of holineſs to the Lord, through all this, and that which letted; Salvation to his Name, <hi>Amen.</hi> So his ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs, even ſo it is in truth, in which I ſet to my ſeal of my right-hand, that God is true, in which Life I give thanks to his Name of Power and Defence, the which over all Nations is to be exalted in the hearts of his Saints, as in the ancient dayes; yea, and much more abundantly in the Light of his bright-ſhining Countenance, in which his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and excellent Glory, and pure dreadful Majeſty, for ever hath his holy habitation; to whom be endleſs Dominion, with Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

It was in the eighth month, the eighth day of the month, in the night, according to their account; and the wind of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der blew down another Powder-houſe, a quarter of a mile from it, but the Powder was preſerved; and it did great execution in the City, as they ſay, it blowed down five Houſes, and broke moſt of the Glaſs Windows of both Palaces, and all the Merchants Windows in the City; and the Magazine where the Merchants Goods were, the Doors were blown out of the hooks, and the Walls ſhaken and torn, and the whole City was terribly ſhaken,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:38158:122" rendition="simple:additions"/> and the doors of the houſes drew up, ſo that great fear fell upon them all; and we heard a great ſhreem in the City, it was at mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, and they rung out their Bells; and there was a great Glaſs Window in the Chamber where we lay, over right our Beds-feet, it was very thick Glaſs, and much of it was broken to pieces, and beat in on each ſide of our bed, but the Lord did not ſuffer any harm to us, the glory is his own. The Houſe was ſo ſhaken, that we did exceedingly fear and quake, but it was taken from us in a moment of time, and we gave up unto the Lord to live or to die, and we had great joy and peace in the Lord. And when it was day the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi> came to us, and asked of us whether we were not dead, becauſe we were ſtill and quiet; and while he was ſpeaking, there came in one after another declaring what was done in the City; and he told us how all his Chamber doors were drew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, and what great fear he was in, and all the States in the City; he ſaid the Ships in the Harbour had ſome harm too. There was never the like known in that place they ſaid. We anſwered them, ſaying, <hi>One Wo is paſt, and behold another Wo cometh quickly, if you do not repent:</hi> yet they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:38158:123"/> not of their blaſphemy, rebellion, hard-heartedneſs, nor unbelief, but they ran up and down to their fathers the Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers, Inchanters and Wiſards, and they ſoon piec'd them up again. There were many of the Friars did dwell near the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul</hi>'s, and we did ſee their running to and fro; and in few dayes after <hi>Sarah</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to faſting, and to baldneſs, and to ſtrew aſhes upon her head, and to ſit upon the ground with her upper parts naked for ſome time, and the Power of the Lord did work mightily in it, and they were amazed at it from the greateſt to the leaſt; and the Lord opened her mouth, and ſhe ſpake to the <hi>Conſul</hi> to tell the <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim a Faſt, and to meet together to wait upon the Lord, with their minds turned to the Light; for the Lord called for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for faſting and baldneſs, and girding on of ſackcloth, that ſo he might turn away his righteous Judgments from them; for the hour of his Judgments was come, wherein the Painted Harlot ſhould be ſtripped naked, and a Cup of trembling ſhould be given her from the hand of the Lord; and many did die of a violent Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; and we were much exerciſed in faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and the <hi>Conſul</hi> went forth with the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:38158:123"/> news amongſt the Magiſtrates, and they talked with the Friars, and they told them we had a good intent; and in a ſhort time after the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> ſent a <hi>Dutch</hi> Friar and one of the other; the Lord had prepared us for their coming; and when they came the <hi>Conſul</hi> called us before them, and ſo he talked a little while with us, and he ſaid, <hi>we had a good intent, but the Devil had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived us.</hi> We asked him, whether the Devil could give power over ſin, yea or nay? He ſaid, <hi>the Devil could transform himſelf into an Angel of Light.</hi> We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, we did know he could, but he could not hide himſelf from the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Light: but they that were in the dark could not diſcern him. He was not able to hear us, nor to ſtay in the room, but the <hi>Conſul</hi> did ſtand up againſt us, and accuſed us to him falſly before our faces, as we made it to appear to him, and ſo they departed; and the <hi>Conſul</hi> wrought deſperately againſt us to get us into bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage again, but our God was with us: and ſeeing he could not prevail againſt us, to get us into Priſon again, then he and his Confederates combined together how to cheat us of our Money. I do believe they received the Books before we came
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:38158:124"/> out of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> for we received dear <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Letter from <hi>Legorn</hi> that did men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them: We felt his workings day and night, he came ſubtilly to us, and told us he had wrought to ſet us at liberty, and the <hi>Quiſitor</hi> and <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> bid him ſend us away by the next convenient paſſage; But now the Devil had ſent Books out of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and he ſaid he knew not what to do with them, the Magiſtrates would not let us go; if they ſhould know of them, they would ſay we would ſend more when we came to <hi>England;</hi> and he asked us whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the we would receive them? We asked him, whether they were directed to us? he ſaid, <hi>No.</hi> We bid him deliver them where they were directed, whatſoever we did ſuffer for it. He kept much ado and ſaid, <hi>If we would give a grandy Prieſt ten or twelve Scoothes,</hi> (which is near fifty ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings) <hi>they would conceal them.</hi> We an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Nay, it was of the Lord, in love to their ſouls, he ſhould deliver them up, and make good uſe of them that their ſouls might live. He raged at us, but ſaid no more of that to us.</p>
               <p>In a little while after there came a <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> Ship, which was bound for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> and the <hi>Conſul</hi> ſent to us to come &amp; ſpeak
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:38158:124"/> with him, it was in the evening, I was going to bed; I felt a filthy thing, and had no freedom to go to him, but <hi>Sarah</hi> went; yet he came to me and told me, <hi>There was a Holland Ship bound for</hi> Smyrna, <hi>if we would promiſe him to ſtay there till he came back, he would call for us.</hi> We told the <hi>Conſul,</hi> we ſtood in the Will of God, and we could not promiſe any thing, unleſs we knew the mind of God in it. He was very angry, and ſaid <hi>we would dwell at Malta.</hi> Now we told him, we did believe the Lord had appointed a Veſſel to carry us, whether it was that yea or nay, we knew not; we did not know whether that might come back in half a year; and however we did not mean to hire a Ship on purpoſe to fetch us. We ſaid he might ſend us in a Barque to <hi>Meſcena,</hi> and there we might imbarque for <hi>Legorn.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>No; the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitor ſaid if we ſhould go thither, we would preach God to the Roman Catholicks, and he did not love that; and there was an</hi> Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>that did belong to the King of</hi> Spain, <hi>and though the Pope had ſet us free, yet he would take us Priſoners again.</hi> We told him we would adventure that; but he had an end of his own in it: he had much Anniſe to ſend to <hi>Legorn,</hi> and he would have had us
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:38158:125"/> to engage the <hi>Flemen</hi> to call for us to carry that too, that we might have paid part for the carriage of it; but our God had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a greater work for us to do which we knew not of.</p>
               <p>In a little time after we were freed from the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> he told us <hi>Daniel</hi> took up an hundred Dollers, and he would have us ſend to <hi>Meſcena</hi> for an hundred more. We told him, we had received no ſuch order, and withal asked him what we ſhould do with ſo much money, ſeeing we had mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his hands? and ſaid, we would not ſend for money to keep us in bonds; and minded him of his Promiſe to dear <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Baker.</hi> He ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us out of Priſon, but he had ſtood Cap in hand to the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> for us. That was true, if he had continued faithful, great would have been his reward, but he ſought himſelf in it; and when his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected end was not anſwered, then he and his wife and ſervants were very bitter againſt us for Righteouſneſs ſake, in-ſo-much that we ſtood in great hazard of our lives; many a time we did feel their ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Inſtruments drawn, ſo that we had even the ſentence of death in our ſelves, but the Lord prevented them, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:38158:125"/> us, and great was our travel of ſoul night and day; the glory is the Lord's, whoſe mighty Power did the work: ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſes, honour and dominion over all to our pure, holy and perfect Lord God, world without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                  </gap>he <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi> this is a true and brief Relation. Three quarters of a year before <hi>Daniel Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> came to <hi>Malta,</hi> the <hi>Conſul</hi> for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> came to us, and ſaid, <hi>the Inquiſitor ſent him to know if we would be Catholicks yea or nay?</hi> We anſwered, we were true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. He ſaid, <hi>if we would be Catholicks, we might dwell at</hi> Melita, <hi>or go to</hi> England. We ſaid we were the Servants of the true and living God. One of the Magiſtrates ſaid, <hi>we were not Chriſtians, neither had we the Croſs of Chriſt.</hi> We anſwered, we were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and had received the Spirit of Chriſt which made a Chriſtian, and he that had not the Spirit of Chriſt was no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and we had the Croſs of Chriſt; without the Croſs there was no Salvation: the Croſs of Chriſt is the Power of God unto Salvation, to every one that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:38158:126"/>
               <p>He ſaid, <hi>If we would not be Catholicks, we muſt ſuffer long Impriſonment by the Popes Order.</hi> That was not true, I had an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer in my Conſcience againſt it. And in a little time after they told us, <hi>if we would kiſs the Croſs we ſhould be freed out of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and go to the Conſul's till a convenient paſſage did preſent to carry us for</hi> England; for the Pope had ſent word they ſhould take it into their conſideration, and ſet us free for <hi>England,</hi> without doing any violencce, as we heard, and we did believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we had a more ſure word of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy than did uſe to proceed out of their mouthes: we told them we could not kiſs the Croſs to get our liberty, neither did we deſire our freedom on any ſuch terms; but we looked every day when they would call us forth to kiſs the Croſs, and we did pray and cry mightily to our Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prevent them in it, and to preſerve us out of it; for the Tempter was very ſtrong within and without, ſo that I took little reſt for many dayes and nights, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great danger it would plunge us into; for I ſaw the painted walls, and the Croſſes ſet before me, but the gracious God of power, who did appear in our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and revealed his Will to me in a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:38158:126"/> Night-Viſion, ſaying, <hi>Touch not, taſte not, handle not, but wait diligently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me: you have two things yet to work over before you can be ſet at liberty.</hi> We knew the Croſs was one, but we knew not what the other was.</p>
               <p>The next time the <hi>Conſul</hi> came, he told us that the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> ſaid, <hi>If any one would engage for three or four thouſand Dollers to be paid if ever we came thither again, we ſhould be ſet at liberty,</hi> but he ſaid no more of the Croſs; but the Obligation was the ſecond thing that we were to work over, but I could never ſee, nor dare deſire any man to be engaged for us, becauſe I do know all Decrees, Laws, Tyes, Bonds and Chains, and Precepts of men muſt be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken through the righteous Decree of our mighty Lord God, and upon the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration we were made willing to wait, till the Lord ſhould break this Chain alſo, that no other dear Friend or Lamb of God might ſuffer for the ſame thing; no, God forbid.</p>
               <p>Then it pleaſed the Lord to ſend <hi>Daniel Baker,</hi> who in obedience to the God of Heaven did offer up body for body, yea life &amp; all for our liberty, but could not be heard; but the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> ſaid, <hi>If any would
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:38158:127"/> engage for the payment of three or four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Dollers, to be paid if ever we came there again, we ſhould have our liberty; but other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we muſt die in the Priſon, for that was the Pope's Law:</hi> but we knew it was left to his conſideration, ſo we told them we could not engage, nor deſire any to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for us, becauſe it was out of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God; and our <hi>yea was yea,</hi> and our <hi>nay was nay,</hi> and we did not believe that ever it was the mind of God that we ſhould return thither again. So <hi>Daniel</hi> departed in the Love of God, and they ſent to <hi>England</hi> to Friends, and to other Iſlands to the Engliſh Merchants, for ſome to engage for us, that we might have our liberty, but the Merchants ſent word they were not willing to anſwer their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable demands, for the payment of ſo many thouſand Dollers, if in caſe we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned thither again. There were many that did ſeek for our liberty, that were not of us, becauſe they knew our cruel and ſtrait bondage and terrible afflictions, and were willing to engage what was reaſon; but becauſe our juſt and wiſe God would make his Power known for his own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, he would not ſuffer any thing to prevail for our Deliverance, inſomuch as
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:38158:127"/> we could underſtand, but what he wrought by his inviſible Power in the hearts of our Enemies. It was given into my heart half a year after <hi>Daniel</hi> came thence, that if I could ſpeak with the <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> he would grant us our liberty; and in a little time he came to the Inquiſition-Court-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and we heard of it, and deſired to ſpeak with him, which he granted us, and we told him we had wronged none, we had defrauded none, neither was guile found in our mouthes; but we had ſuffered inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently almoſt four years, for Conſcience-ſake, and we knew they had no peace in our ſufferings. So the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> was very courteous to us, and promiſed our liberty in a few dayes, and he ſaid he would ſend for the <hi>Conſul,</hi> and get him to engage for five hundred Dollers to be paid for us, if ever we came again; in caſe the <hi>Conſul</hi> did deny it, he would ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> to the Pope for an Order to ſet us at liberty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Obligation. So we were contented to wait the Lord's time; who had often promiſed us, <hi>That we ſhould have our liberty in a day when we thought not of, and at an hour when we were not aware;</hi> and good was the Word of the Lord, and faithful in all his Promiſes.</p>
               <pb n="252" facs="tcp:38158:128"/>
               <p>About two weeks after the <hi>Inquiſitor</hi> came to the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> with his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and other of the Magiſtrates, and a <hi>Conſul</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and he ſent the Proctor of the Court to call us forth before them; and when we came he told us, <hi>the Conſul would engage for the payment of five hundred Dollers, if ever we returned thither again.</hi> We not knowing at preſent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was the mind of our heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Earth ſhould help the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man yea or nay, yet waiting in the Fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>r of God, it was brought to my remembrance that the Lord had ſaid <hi>we had two things to work over, before we could be ſet at liberty.</hi> So they uſed many words, but we eying the Lord, yet anſwered them in the Spirit of meekneſs. They called for half a ſheet of paper, and the <hi>Chancellour</hi> asked what he ſhould write? but the Lord ſtood up for his own glory, ſo that they had not power to write one Letter. The <hi>Lieutenant</hi> ſaid, <hi>they would talk of it another time;</hi> and they did ask us, <hi>whether we would not return back again to our Husbands and Children, if it were the will of God?</hi> We anſwered, It was our intent in the will of God ſo to do. The <hi>Lord Inquiſitor</hi> took his leave very courteouſly of us, and deſired our proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:38158:128"/> return into our Country; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Magiſtrates, with the inferiour Officers, not requiring penny or penny-worths for any Fees or Attendance that we had among them in that time; but as we ſaw our freedom in the Lord, we gave the Keeper and ſome poor men ſomething for Conſcience ſake.</p>
               <p>So we departed in peace, according to the compleat example of the holy men of God, kneeling down and deſiring our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father never to lay to their charge what they did unto us, becauſe they knew us not; ſo this Scripture was fulfilled, <hi>that he made our enemies our footſtool, and they that hate us without a cauſe to be at peace with us.</hi> So we were delivered in Power and great glory out of the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> into the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s hand to be ſent for <hi>England,</hi> as opportunity did preſent. The <hi>Conſul</hi> ſaid that he did engage for us after we were out of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> but we could never find that it was true.</p>
               <p>So we were kept eleven weeks at the <hi>Conſul's</hi> houſe, before they could have a paſſage to carry us out of their Coaſt; and the Croſs was ſo heavy, and the travel of ſouls ſo great, that, as to the viſible, all hopes were paſt that I could live in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy;
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:38158:129"/> but all things are poſſible with God, who by his mighty Power hath removed Mountains, and ſubdued the Earth, and broke through the double-doors, locks and bolts, and Iron bars, and all the chains of wickedneſs, &amp; every unrighteous Decree; and by his high &amp; mighty Hand and ſtrong outſtretched Arm hath returned our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, that <hi>Jacob</hi> may rejoyce and <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be glad, magnified be the Name of our Eternal Father for ever; yea, Honour and Glory, Power and Dominion over all to him who ruleth on high, world without end, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when we had been at the <hi>Conſul</hi>'s houſe eleven weeks, there came one of the King's Frigats, called the <hi>Saphire,</hi> the Captain's name was <hi>Samuel Titſwel.</hi> The <hi>Grand-Maſter</hi> ſent to the Captain of the <hi>Saphire</hi> to entreat him to ſtay the Ship all night, to take up almoſt forty Paſſengers. The Captain made himſelf unwilling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had no product, but lay out in the Road a league from the City. The <hi>Grand-Maſter</hi> writ to him, he knew his brother at <hi>England</hi> would not deny him ſuch a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie to take in twenty four Knights, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valliers, and their ſervants, and two <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and ſo he ſtaid till the next day, it
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:38158:129"/> was for his great advantage. Upon pain of death the Cavaliers muſt not ſee us heretofore, but our heavenly Father doth know how to bring his own purpoſes to paſs, and none can hinder him.</p>
               <p>Oh! that we ſhould be put on board with ſo many of them, and one was the <hi>Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors</hi> own brother, as he ſaid, and was as like him as if the ſame man, as I told the Captain, before I knew who he was: he ſpake to the Captain often that we might not want any thing that was in the Ship, and he told us if we were at <hi>Malta</hi> again we ſhould not be perſecuted ſo; for as ſoon as he ſaw our faces he ſaid, <hi>he would not differ with us;</hi> he and ſome other of them laid to the Captain, <hi>If we went to Heaven one way, and they another, yet we ſhould all meet together at the laſt.</hi> But we held out Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World, to be the <hi>alone way</hi> to the Father: And great was our labour from day to day. But our own Country-men were much worſe than moſt of them, ſo that they bid us go back to <hi>Malta</hi> again; and ſaid the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh would uſe us worſe than the Maltezes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So when we came to <hi>Legorn,</hi> the Ship could get no product, and if we would go a-ſhoar there, we might go into the <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retta</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="tcp:38158:130"/> for forty dayes. And ſo the King's Agent deſired the Captain to carry us as far as he could, till he met the General, and then he would provide a paſſage for us, if that Ship was commanded back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; for if he ſhould have left us there in <hi>Lazaretta,</hi> the Agent muſt take order for us, he ſaid, according to the King's Order. The Merchants ſhewed us no ſmall kindneſs, and treated us with much love, and ſent us Wine and Bread, and a great many good things for our refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the Sea was high ſo that they could not conveniently come to us, but they told the Captain they would come; and if we would have money or any thing elſe whatſoever we would write for, they would ſend it to us. We had but little money, but being we were coming for our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, we ſaw but little freedom to take up money: And the Captain promiſed, as we ſhould not want any money, nor any thing elſe till we came to <hi>England;</hi> ſo he ſhould not have taken any money for our paſſage, becauſe it was the King's Ship, but he received ſeveral Dollers which victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alled the Ship; So he haſted thence and came to <hi>Tarloone,</hi> and there he could get no product, but all the <hi>Malta</hi> Knights were
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:38158:130" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſet a-ſhoar into <hi>Lazaretta:</hi> ſo we came to <hi>Malago,</hi> and there the Captain had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but he did not dare to make any long ſtay there, for fear the Fleet ſhould be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at <hi>Tangeer.</hi> He was ſent before the Fleet out of <hi>Turkie,</hi> with Letters to <hi>Malta,</hi> and to <hi>Legorn,</hi> and other places, and we had ſome ſervice for the Lord in every Harbour.</p>
               <p>So we came to <hi>Tangeer</hi> above two weeks before the Fleet came. The Captain ſaid it was above an hundred pound out of his way, becauſe he made ſo much haſte. The Lord did haſten him for his Work's ſake, as it was clearly manifeſted to us all along. The Captain ſaid we muſt not go a-ſhoar till he had ſpoke with the Governour's Excellency.</p>
               <p>So we went a-ſhoar as we were moved of the Lord, and great was our Work for the Seeds ſake. Oh! oh! great are the Abominations of the wicked in that place; none worſe than Engliſh-men for ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lying, pride, drunkenneſs, whoredoms, and ſuch like, ſo that our righteous ſouls were vexed day and night with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean converſation, and the pure Spirit of the Lor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> was grieved, and the Seed of God was preſſed, even as a Cart is preſſed with
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:38158:131"/> ſheaves; So we declared boldly againſt them all in the Name of the Lord, and they came flocking about us, high and low, great and ſmall, into the houſe where we were lodged, or where-ever we went, of all ſorts. In a few days we were moved to go to the Governour, and to lay their Abominations before him, the juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments due unto them from the Lord for their great and grievous Wickedneſs; and laid it upon him from the Lord to ſuppreſs it, in ſo much as lay in him to do, leſt the juſt and holy Lord God Almighty did ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly deliver them into the hands of their Enemies to be deſtroyed, after the reſt of them were ſlain in the Wrath and Anger of the Almighty: and we told him they had not greater enemies without than they had within, and if they did repent and truly fear the Lord, their Enemies would be ſubdued within, and they would know when to go out againſt their Enemies and proſper, and the Lord would make their Enemies to be at peace with them. So the Governour ſaid, he did lovingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our good Inſtructions and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and promiſed to follow our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; and would have given us money, and deſired us to eat and drink in his houſe.
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:38158:131"/> We did freely imbrace his love, without meat, drink or money.</p>
               <p>And he was very courteous to us, and tender over us, ſo that he gave Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to all the Gariſon, <hi>That none ſhould abuſe us in word nor action, upon pain of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere puniſhment.</hi> There are many <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gals, Jews</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> which could as freely have burnt us, as they could have burnt wood; but our pure, holy, wiſe, ſtrong and powerful Lord God, protected us in the midſt of them, and took away all ſlaviſh fear from us, ſo that we were as bold as Lions for God's Truth, againſt all their Idolatry and Wickedneſs. The Lord is worthy to have the glory for evermore, <hi>Amen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in a few dayes after it was laid upon us of the Lord, to go forth to meet the <hi>Moors</hi> their Enemies, which laid ſiege a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and they were ſuch a bloody ſavage people, that it ſeemed a very hard thing to us, but the Lord ſaid unto me, <hi>Go forth, fear not, they ſhall not harm thée, or you, Behold the Sword of the Lord and of</hi> Gideon <hi>is with you.</hi> And ſo we believed, and were made willing to adventure life and all in obedience. And ſo we went to the Governour to deſire we
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:38158:132"/> might be let out of the Gate, declaring the mind of God in it: but the Governor told us, <hi>we muſt expect nothing but cruel death, or bonds for ever,</hi> telling us what terrible weapons they had, and entreated us to go again to our lodging, and wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord, and pray as our manner was, he ſaid, and then if we could not have peace, we might come to him again. And in two or three dayes after he came to us, and asked us concerning the thing. We told him we were made willing to bear and to wait upon the Lord to perſwade his heart to let us go, and ſaid we did believe the Lord would preſerve us in the midſt of them, and deliver us from them, and we ſhould be returned as ſafe as we went forth; yet however our bodies were but a reaſonable ſacrifice to offer for him that gave them us. So he left us at that time. After that we went to his houſe again, and he did ſeem to be ſomewhat willing then to let us go. Then his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary ſtept to him, and deſired him that he would not let us go, declaring to him that if he did let us go, that it could not poſſibly be expected that ever we ſhould return into the City again, or ſee any of our Relations or Country, except the Lord
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:38158:132"/> did work a wonderful Miracle by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us out of their hands: And then the Governour told us in pitty and tenderneſs towards us, he believing we were innocent harmleſs women, and did truly fear God, he could not let us go forth, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> would ſpeak very hardly of him, and ſay he forced us forth to be deſtroyed by them. So in a day or two after the <hi>Moors</hi> did ſhew forth their Flag to parley for Peace, and came near to treat with them, and till then our ſouls, hearts and ſpirits were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in ſuch ſtrong travel and labour night and day, we could not hide it from the people of the houſe where we lay; but we do believe if we had gone forth among them before they came to treat with them, the Lord our God who liveth for ever, would have preſerved us, and we ſhould have been returned, to the conviction of many, and to the aſtoniſhment of all the whole Gariſon, for his own glory: but if we ſhould have gone forth to them when they came to parley for Peace, then our Country-men would have ſaid, that that was the reaſon we were preſerved, and God would not have had the glory. The Lord ſaid, <hi>our Sacrifice was accepted,</hi> becauſe he knew the uprightneſs of our hearts.</p>
               <pb n="262" facs="tcp:38158:133"/>
               <p>We went to take our leaves of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour, having finiſhed our Teſtimonies in that place, acknowledging the love we received from him; and he proffered us whatever we wanted for the Ship, and his kindneſs extended ſo far that he would ſend it to the Veſſel. We received his love, but took nothing of him, and ſo we departed the City, and went aboard the Ship that brought us thither; and that Ship was commanded back into the <hi>Straits,</hi> ſo that we were deſtitute of a paſſage. So <hi>Sarah</hi> being moved of the Lord, went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the General and made him acquainted therewith, and he very lovingly ſent us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board in another Ship, and bade us take care for nothing, he would give Order we ſhould not want any thing till we came to <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When we were ready to ſet ſail, there came a mighty Scool of Fiſh dancing round the Ship, and leaping above water with great joy, as I am a witneſs of; and as I waited on the Lord, conſidering what it might ſignifie, the Lord anſwered me, <hi>It ſignified the multitudes of his Saints and Servants in</hi> England <hi>or elſewhere, that will rejoyce at the return of our Captivity, and glorifie his Name:</hi> which
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:38158:133" rendition="simple:additions"/> cauſed great joy and refreſhment to our ſouls. The Lord made it manifeſt we ſhould have a ſafe paſſage to <hi>England,</hi> and cauſed us to declare it, ſo that many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to return with us in that Ship on that account; yet I told them we might meet with ſtorms and hardſhips by the way, and ſo it came to paſs; and great tryals we had by reaſon of ſtorms and tempeſtuous weather, that we were in great danger and peril, ſo that many were wounded and bruiſed with the toſſing of the Veſſel, and the Maſter of the Ship caſt over-board, when the Sea was ſo high as Mountains; yet the Lord wrought wonderfully for his deliverance, and he was brought into the Ship ſafe again, and we all came ſafe to Land. The Captain was a very civil man, and we were very civilly uſed in that Ship. We were ſcattered from all the reſt of the Ships, and could never ſee them again. And ſo the Name of the Lord be magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ever over all, whoſe Name is a ſtrong Tower to all that can truſt in him.</p>
               <p>It is laid upon me to manifeſt the large love of God to us in our greateſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, when we knew nothing but that we ſhould be burnt for many dayes together.

                  <q rend="margQuotes">Then in a Viſion of the night I ſaw a large Room, and a great Wood-fire in the Chimney; and I ſaw the eternal Son of God ſitting in a Chair by the fire, in the form of a ſervant: And likewiſe I ſaw a very amiable well-favoured Man-Child ſitting in a hollow Chair over the fire, it had no clothes on but a little fine linen about the upper parts, it did not appear to be above three quarters old; the fire did flame on every ſide of it, yet the Child did play and was merry: I would have took it up, for fear it ſhould have been burnt, but he that ſate in the Chair bade me let it alone.

The Light will diſcover every deed of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; it is the faithful and true Witneſs of God, which he hath given to every one a meaſure to profit, to convince, to reprove, to inſtruct, to condemn, to juſtifie. And thoſe that receive the Light in the love thereof, to them he doth reveal his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting loving-kindneſs, and make known the Myſteries of his Truth and Counſel. <hi>The willing and obedient ſhall eat the good of the Land, but thoſe that refuſe and rebel, the Sword of the Lord ſhall devour.

               <p>Every one that loveth the Light, will bring their deeds to the Light, that they may be approved of the Light that they are wrought in God; for to the Light of Chriſt all muſt come; and whatſoever hath been done in ſecret ſhal be made manifeſt; when the Book of every ones Conſcience ſhall be laid open, then ſhall every ones heart be made manifeſt by the Light, and ſhall receive every one according to their deeds done in the body: <hi>they that ſow to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but they that ſow to the Spirit, ſhall reap life everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: For the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life, through Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; who is the Light of the World, that lighteth every one that cometh into the World, that all men through him might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.

               <p>Accordingly, about the middle of the aforeſaid month, I began my Voyage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and imbarqued with four Friends more, in a Ship (called <hi>The Joſhua of London</hi>) bound for <hi>Legorn</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> where in ahout ſix weeks time we arrived; and ſoon after we were ſent for by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of that place, who after examination of us, whither we were going (and the like) ſaid, <hi>we muſt not ſtay aſhore, but go aboard a Ship, there to abide until we could get paſſage

<pb n="283" facs="tcp:38158:143"/> were preſerved, and came ſafe to the place whither we were bound: yet great was the enmity that aroſe in the Friars in that place, whereby their children would hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receive me, though I was willing to give to the utmoſt for what neceſſaries I had occaſion for, which I had done before (as they alſo knew) yet by reaſon of the Fryars and Jeſuites enmity at the preſent, many of their party feared to receive me, neither did I know a place outwardly where to lay my head with ſafety; nay, not ſo much as upon a ſtone, unleſs the Lord did wonderfully preſerve me, which in my heart I did believe he would do; whereby I remained content in my ſpirit, without any murmuring, and began to walk out of the City (it raining) to lie down in the field (for what I knew) but there came a <hi>French</hi> Merchant, called <hi>Sur-Rubie,</hi> whom the Lord (after my exerciſe) had prepared to receive me, a man that I had never ſeen before (that I knew of) who friendly took me unto his houſe as I was paſſing along, where I remained above twenty dayes, and he would often ſpeak unto me, ſaying, <hi>Surely it was the Lord's doing</hi> (his receiving of me) <hi>for,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my own Country-men, when they come to me,

<pb n="285" facs="tcp:38158:144"/> old man appeared, and in my behalf op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them, and through the Lord's great goodneſs liberty was obtained for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back to <hi>Joppa</hi> by Sea, contrary to the wills of the Friars, who thought to have ſent me back again out of thoſe parts; for within about three or four dayes, a Veſſel being bound for <hi>Joppa</hi> I entred therein, and in about a dayes time arrived there, where ſome Friars alſo (who went along in the ſame Veſſel) ſought to hinder me from going to <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> but I going aſhoar before them, payed for my paſſage, and ſo went on my Journey alone; where having met with many people in the way peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably paſſed by me, untill I came about ſix miles, and then I met with three men, two of them riding upon Aſſes, and the other going on foot; they asked me for money, one of them holding his Gun to my breaſt, and another of them put his hand into my pockets &amp; took ſome things out, I not reſiſting them, but ſtood in the fear of the Lord, who preſerved me, for they paſſed away; and he that took my things forth of my pockets, put them up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, taking nothing from me, nor did me the leaſt harm, but one of them took me by the hand and led me a little on my way
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:38158:145"/> in a friendly manner, and ſo left me. So I paſſing through the like dangers (through the great love of God, which cauſed me to glorifie his bleſſed Name) I came (though in much weakneſs of body) unto <hi>Ramlah,</hi> or <hi>Ramoth Gilead,</hi> and going through the Town I was known (having been there before) two men of the ſaid Town, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents to the Friars (which before had oppoſed me) aroſe and laid hold on me, and hurried me in a violent manner to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the place in the Town, in which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had been kept priſoner; but as they were abuſing me, there came two <hi>Turks</hi> and threw them violently from me, and took me from them, one leading me by one arm, the other by the other arm, and in that manner brought me to one of their Houſes of Worſhip or <hi>Moſco;</hi> and I being entered thereinto, many people gathered together therein, alſo the Prieſts of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> before whom I was called and cauſed to ſit down; And then it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of me, <hi>Whether I would turn unto the Turks Religion?</hi> I anſwered, I could not turn unto them: but they preſſed me very much, and ſaid they would give me great things, and I ſhould not need fear what the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> could do unto me.
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:38158:145"/> Nevertheleſs I anſwered, I could not turn unto them for all the World: yet mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly did many ſtrive with me with an ardent affection, and would have had me hold up one finger, as a ſign of owning them: and one bid me ſay, <hi>Chriſt is bad;</hi> I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I knew him to be good, and I was his Servant. Then ſome of the chief of them were diſpleaſed very much, and ſaid, <hi>If I would not turn to their Religion, I ſhould die.</hi> I anſwered, I ſhould rather die than turn unto them. It was anſwered, <hi>I ſhould then die.</hi> So they gave order to the Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner (for, as I underſtand, they execute preſently after Sentence) who haled me away to the place where it was expected I ſhould have been burnt to death with Camels dung, and ſo ſate me down upon the ground, where the Lord preſerved me over the fear of men, though I was as a Sheep prepared for the ſlaughter. And thus it came to paſs, whilſt ſome appeared very violent, the Lord raiſed up ſome others amongſt them whom he made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in his hand for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my life. And there came an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent tender man, a <hi>Turk,</hi> and of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, unto me, and ſaid, <hi>Whether I would turn from my Religion or not, I ſhould
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:38158:146"/> not die.</hi> Then they brought me before them again, who asked me, <hi>Will you turn?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, Nay. They then recorded it in a Book, that I was no <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but of another Religion; for I had denied the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> unto them, yet owned I was a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this they were much broken down in their ſpirits, as men whoſe ſtrength fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and then the aforeſaid Antient man took me, and ordered his ſervants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me to his houſe, where he friendly entertained me; but within about four or five dayes time there came a Guard of Horſemen, which I underſtood the Friars had hired to bring me before the <hi>Baſhaw</hi> of <hi>Gaza;</hi> for, as it was told me, the Friars in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had pre-informed the ſaid <hi>Baſhaw</hi> againſt me (whom they looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be their chiefeſt friend in all theſe parts) who deſired me to be brought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and ſwore he would kill me in his own perſon; and with the aforeſaid Guard of armed men I was brought in two dayes unto <hi>Gaza</hi> (where <hi>Sampſon</hi> formerly dwelt) where I remained about five days; in which time it was ſaid I ſhould go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Baſhaw,</hi> but it came not ſo to paſs, for he being informed by ſome <hi>Turks</hi> of the
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:38158:146"/> wicked proceedings of the Friars towards me, whereupon he gave order that the Friars ſhould pay an hundred Dollers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe men which had informed him of their bad dealings towards me: and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, thoſe men which brought me to <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> he ordered they ſhould convey me back, and from thence the Friars ſhould cauſe me to be brought to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who were the great oppoſers of my coming thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In this ſaid City I was in a friendly manner both viſited and received by many both <hi>Turks, Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians:</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Armenians</hi> (being profeſſed <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) were raiſed unto much love to me, they underſtanding I owned my ſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and chuſed rather to die than to turn from my Religion: And the <hi>Turks</hi> were raiſed to a loving moderate enquiry, being I ſuffered and went through great things, yet differed from all others. The <hi>Jews</hi> in them parts were moderate towards me likewiſe.</p>
               <p>According to the afore-mentioned Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I was brought to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but being come thither, the Friars laid wait for me, and by their appointment I was taken and brought to their Convent, where at firſt they ſeemingly ſhewed love unto me, and
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:38158:147"/> one confeſſed, <hi>there was now an evident ſign that I was a good Chriſtian, for I was come through Perſecution and Sufferings; and thoſe things which had been ſpoken of me to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary were manifeſt to be untrue.</hi> I anſwered, It was he and his brethren which had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted and cauſed me to ſuffer, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood my coming to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> He ſaid, <hi>The Engliſh</hi> (a Friar like himſelf) <hi>had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed them by writing againſt me, which cauſed them to do what they had done unto me, and deſired I would now paſs thoſe things by, ſeeing I was come in ſuch a miraculous manner; for it was the Lord's work</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>to carry me through, and I might praiſe God I was preſerved.</hi> The next morning there came a Friar unto me, and asked me, <hi>If I would become an obedient child, and go to viſit the Holy Places</hi> (as he called them) <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their cuſtoms?</hi> I anſwered, Nay, I ſhould not viſit them. He ſaid, <hi>Whereas others give great ſums of money to ſee them, I ſhould ſee them for nothing.</hi> I anſwered, Nay, I ſhould not viſit them in their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, for in ſo doing I ſhould ſin againſt God. He ſaid, <hi>they would honour me as much as ever they honoured any Engliſh-man that ever came thither, if I would conform unto them.</hi> I ſaid, Nay, I ſhould not conform;
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:38158:147"/> and as for their honor, I mattered not for it. Then he became wrath and ſaid, <hi>They would make me an example to all Engliſh-men that ſhould come thither.</hi> I ſaid, I choſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their diſhonour than their honour. He then ſeeing he could not prevail over me with his temptations, he in anger paſſed from me, and in a ſhort time came again, and called me to divers of his Brethren; the chief among them asked me, <hi>If I would viſit their Church, and the holy Sepulchre, and</hi> Bethlehem, <hi>and the reſt of the holy places, as other Pilgrims did?</hi> I ſaid, at the preſent I had no buſineſs to viſit them, and in their manner I ſhould not viſit them at all (that is to ſay, worſhip them) Then one of them ſaid, <hi>How could I be a Servant of God, and would not go to viſit the places where the holy men of God dwelt?</hi> I anſwered, That they, under pretence of doing ſervice to God, in viſiting the places where the holy men dwelt, they did oppoſe that Way, and reſiſt that Life, which the holy men of God lived and walked in. One of them ſaid, <hi>What, did I preach unto them?</hi> I ſaid, I would have them turn from thoſe evil practices they lived in, elſe the Wrath of the Almighty would break forth upon them, or words to that effect. They further ſaid, <hi>If I would
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:38158:148"/> not go to viſit the places before-mentioned, would I give the</hi> 25. <hi>Dollers, as is the manner of thoſe that viſited them? for</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>the Turks muſt be paid whether I would viſit them or not; but if I would viſit them, then they would pay it for me.</hi> I ſaid, I would not have them to pay it for me; but if the <hi>Turks</hi> had a Law to compel me to pay 25. Dollers when I viſited not the places, as thoſe did pay that did viſit them, I ſaid that Law was unequal; and I ſhould chuſe rather to ſuffer the penalty of the ſame in breaking it, than to give 25. Dollers to fulfil it.</p>
               <p>After this the Popiſh Friars brought me before a <hi>Turk</hi> in Authority in that place, who asked me di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Queſtions, and ſoberly received Anſwers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; and ſoberly diſcourſed with me about the Worſhip of the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> and alſo asked me the ground of my coming to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> I anſwered him, The Lord God of Heaven and Earth had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto me, and commanded me to come thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in obedience unto him I was come; and further, in the power of the Lord I declared the great and tender love of God in viſiting them, and his great and compaſſionate mercies that he would gather them in this the Day of his gathering. And this was that which lay upon me from the Lord to declare unto them, whether they would hear or forbear.</p>
               <p>And thus, my dear Friends, I cleared my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whether they would hear or forbear; wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I found great peace with the Lord, who in my many tryals was not wanting unto me, but magnified his glorious Name in going along with me, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving me; to whom is all the glory due for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, <hi>Amen.</hi>
